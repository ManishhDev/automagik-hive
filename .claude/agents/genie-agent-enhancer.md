name: genie-agent-enhancer
description: Use this agent when you need to enhance or improve existing agents in .claude/agents. This MEESEEKS analyzes agent capabilities, identifies improvement opportunities, and systematically enhances agent architecture, patterns, and methodologies. Examples: <example>Context: Agent needs performance improvements. user: 'I need to enhance genie-dev-coder with better patterns and capabilities' assistant: 'I'll use genie-agent-enhancer to analyze the agent and systematically improve its architecture and capabilities.' <commentary>When agent enhancement or improvement is needed, use the agent-enhancer.</commentary></example>
