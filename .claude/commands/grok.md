description: Execute any command using GROK-4 model for enhanced reasoning and performance
---

Execute any PagBank Multi-Agent System command using the GROK-4 model for enhanced reasoning and advanced analysis capabilities.

## Enhanced GROK Model Benefits

- **Superior Reasoning**: GROK-4's advanced reasoning capabilities for complex multi-agent problems
- **Large Context**: 256K context window for comprehensive project understanding
- **Real-time Knowledge**: Current information processing and web-aware reasoning
- **Mathematical Excellence**: Advanced mathematical and logical problem solving
- **Code Analysis**: Deep understanding of complex code structures and patterns

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Enhanced code review with GROK reasoning
/grok code-review "Comprehensive analysis of @agents/pagbank/agent.py routing logic"

# Advanced refactoring with GROK intelligence
/grok refactor "@teams/ana/team.py needs sophisticated routing optimization"

# Deep architectural analysis
/grok create-docs "Generate comprehensive documentation for agent orchestration patterns"

# Complex debugging with enhanced reasoning
/grok full-context "Investigate complex interaction between Ana team routing and specialist agents"

# Advanced update analysis
/grok update-docs "Analyze recent V2 implementation changes and update all affected documentation"

# Sophisticated handoff scenarios
/grok handoff "Complex escalation scenario requiring nuanced understanding of customer frustration"
```

## Enhanced Reasoning Patterns

- **Think harder**: Leverage GROK's enhanced reasoning for complex analysis
- **Ultrathink**: Use maximum reasoning depth for critical decisions
- **Think deeply**: Apply sophisticated pattern recognition to multi-agent problems
- **Extended thinking**: Enable comprehensive analysis of business unit interactions

## Model-Specific Optimizations

GROK-4 excels at:
- **Complex System Analysis**: Multi-agent coordination and routing optimization
- **Business Logic Reasoning**: Financial services compliance and Portuguese language nuances
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying sophisticated architectural patterns in Agno framework
- **Real-time Integration**: Current documentation and best practices analysis
- **Mathematical Optimization**: Performance calculations and complexity analysis

## Auto-Enhanced Context Collection

- Project intelligence: !`git status --porcelain | wc -l` modified files, !`find . -name "*.py" | wc -l` Python files
- Business complexity: !`find agents/ -name "*.py" | wc -l` agents, !`find teams/ -name "*.py" | wc -l` teams
- Active development: !`grep -r "\[ \]" genie/active/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l` pending tasks
- System metrics: !`find . -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" | wc -l` configuration files

## Automatic Execution

All commands executed with `/grok [command] [arguments]` will:

1. **Parse the target command** from arguments
2. **Load enhanced context** using GROK's superior reasoning
3. **Execute with GROK-4 model** for all sub-agents and analysis
