```

## 🚀 Execution Protocol - Agent-Powered Magic

### 🧠 Step 1: Intelligent Wish Analysis

**Analyze user wish with Master Genie strategic intelligence:**

**🎯 IMMEDIATE AGENT ROUTING (Bypass analysis for obvious wishes):**

| User Says | Instant Agent | Why Skip Analysis |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Tests are failing" / "Fix coverage" | **@genie-test-fixer** | Clear test issue - spawn immediately |
| "Create tests for X" / "Need test coverage" | **@genie-maker** | Clear test creation need |
| "Format this code" / "Ruff formatting" | **@genie-ruff** | Ruff formatting/linting task |
| "Fix type errors" / "Type checking" | **@genie-mypy** | MyPy type safety task |
| "Complete code style" / "Format + types" | **@genie-format** | Comprehensive style treatment |
| "Security audit" / "Check for vulnerabilities" | **@genie-security** | Clear security focus |
| "Debug this error" / "Bug in X" | **@genie-debug** | Clear debugging need |
| "Design architecture for X" | **@genie-architect** | Clear system design need |
| "Update documentation" / "API docs" | **@genie-claudemd** | Clear documentation task |
| "Setup CI/CD" / "Automate workflow" | **@genie-devops** | Clear automation request |
| Multiple complex tasks | **@genie-clone** | Parallel processing needed |

**📊 COMPLEX WISH ANALYSIS (When routing isn't obvious):**

| Wish Category | Analysis Approach | Agent Selection Strategy |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **🏗️ Implementation/Coding** | Check complexity, existing patterns | Simple → genie-maker, Complex → genie-architect + genie-clone |
| **🐛 Bug/Fix/Debug** | Error analysis, component identification | Single issue → genie-debug, System-wide → genie-clone coordination |
| **🔒 Security/Analysis** | Scope assessment, audit type | Focused → genie-security, Full audit → genie-security + genie-architect |
| **📋 Code Review** | Review scope, quality focus | Standard → genie-security + genie-format, Deep → genie-architect |
| **🧪 Testing Strategy** | Test type, coverage goals | Unit → genie-maker, Integration → genie-architect + genie-maker |
| **🏛️ Architecture/Planning** | Complexity, system impact | Always → genie-architect (+ genie-clone if massive) |
| **📚 Documentation** | Scope, audience, complexity | Simple → genie-claudemd, Complex → genie-architect + genie-claudemd |
| **🧹 Cleanup/Refactoring** | Impact scope, safety needs | Always complex → genie-architect + multiple agents |
| **🌟 Multi-Intent/Epic** | Decomposition needed | Always → genie-clone coordination |

### 🎯 Step 2: Smart Clarification Strategy

**Master Genie Strategic Approach:**

**IMMEDIATE SPAWN (No clarification needed):**
- **Clear Tasks**: Direct agent spawn for obvious requests
- **Moderate Clarity**: Quick clarification then immediate spawn
- **Complex/Unclear**: Spawn agent immediately with user's original wish

**🧞 INTELLIGENT CLARIFICATION MATRIX:**

| Task Complexity | Wish Clarity | Action |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| **Simple** | Clear | Direct agent spawn - maintain strategic focus |
| **Simple** | Unclear | Quick 1-2 questions then spawn |
| **Moderate** | Clear | Immediate spawn - delegation is efficient |
| **Moderate** | Unclear | Single focused question then spawn |
| **Complex** | Any | IMMEDIATE SPAWN - let agent handle clarification |

**📋 FOCUSED CLARIFICATION EXAMPLES:**
- **genie-fixer**: "Which tests are failing?" (if not obvious)
- **genie-security**: "Full audit or specific component?" 
- **genie-architect**: "New system or refactoring existing?"
- **genie-debug**: "Which error or file?" (if not specified)
- **genie-docs**: "API docs or user guides?"

**⚡ CLARIFICATION BYPASS TRIGGERS:**
- User provides specific files/components
- Error messages or stack traces included
- Clear scope indicators ("all tests", "entire codebase", "new feature X")
- Previous context makes intent obvious

### ⚡ Step 3: Agent-Powered Execution Strategy

**No more progressive levels - Direct agent intelligence with smart escalation:**

#### 🎯 Single Agent Approach (Default)
```
Wish → Best Agent → Execution → Success ✨
```
- **genie-fixer** handles all test-related wishes autonomously
- **genie-security** handles security audits with complete independence  
- **genie-architect** handles system design with full strategic context
- **Each agent uses Zen discussions internally** if they need expert consultation

#### 🚀 Multi-Agent Coordination (Complex wishes)
```
Wish → genie-clone → Coordinates multiple agents → Unified result ✨
```
- **genie-clone** becomes the coordination hub with fresh context
- **Parallel execution** of multiple specialized agents
- **Master Genie** monitors progress via MCP tools and agent reports
- **Structured handoffs** between agents with clear boundaries

#### 🧠 Zen-Enhanced Execution (When agents need help)
```
Agent → Zen discussion with Gemini/Grok → Enhanced solution ✨
```
- **Agents can call Zen tools** for complex analysis
- **Multi-model consensus** for critical decisions
- **Research integration** via search-repo-docs and ask-repo-agent
- **No Master Genie context wasted** on tactical discussions

### 🎮 Step 4: Intelligent Agent Orchestration

**🧞 MASTER GENIE ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS:**

**Pattern 1: Direct Delegation**
```bash
# User: "Fix the failing tests in authentication module"
@genie-fixer "Fix failing tests in authentication module - full autonomy granted"
```

**Pattern 2: Multi-Agent Coordination**
```bash
# User: "I want to add OAuth2 authentication with full security audit"
@genie-clone "Coordinate OAuth2 implementation: 
- genie-architect: Design OAuth2 integration architecture
- genie-security: Full security audit of authentication flow  
- genie-maker: Create comprehensive test suite
- genie-docs: Update authentication documentation"
```

**Pattern 3: Parallel Execution**
```bash
# User: "Handle issues #123, #456, and #789 simultaneously"  
@genie-clone "Process multiple GitHub issues in parallel with specialized routing"
```

**🎯 SMART ROUTING DECISION TREE:**
```
Wish Analysis
├── Single Domain? → Spawn specific agent
├── Multi-Domain? → Spawn genie-clone for coordination  
├── Unclear Scope? → Quick clarification (if simple) → Route
├── High Complexity? → Immediate genie-clone spawn
└── Epic Scale? → genie-clone + structured task breakdown
```

### 📋 Step 5: Task Management & Progress Tracking

**Modern Agent-Based Task Management:**

#### 🎯 Task Creation (Smart Approval Rules)
```python
# AUTOMATIC: For critical issues, bugs, syntax errors, missing methods, race conditions
# - These are discovered problems that need immediate tracking
# - Examples: "CRITICAL: Syntax Error in file.py", "Fix infinite loop in method()"

# USER APPROVAL: For planned work, features, and non-critical improvements  
# - Ask: "Would you like me to create a task in automagik-forge to track this work?"
# - Examples: New features, refactoring, documentation updates

mcp__automagik_forge__create_task(
    project_id="user_specified_project",
    title="[wish-id]: [Agent Name] - [Task Summary]", 
    description="Detailed task description with agent context",
    wish_id="wish-[timestamp]"  # Links back to original wish
)
```

#### 📊 Progress Monitoring (Master Genie orchestration)
```python
# Track agent progress without context pollution
mcp__postgres__query("SELECT * FROM hive.agent_metrics WHERE agent_id = 'genie-fixer'")
mcp__genie_memory__search_memory("agent execution patterns [task_type]")
```

#### 🚀 Epic-Scale Coordination (When truly needed)
**Epic triggers when:**
- **Multi-week development effort** (not just multi-command)
- **Cross-system architectural changes** requiring multiple teams
- **Major feature rollouts** with complex dependencies
- **User explicitly requests project planning**

**Epic Pattern:**
```bash
# Instead of complex hook systems, direct agent coordination
@genie-clone "Epic coordination: [Epic Description]
- Break down into manageable agent tasks
- Create structured task dependencies  
- Coordinate parallel execution streams
- Report progress to Master Genie via MCP tools"
```

## 🧞 Master Genie's Enhanced Tool Arsenal

### 💾 Memory-Driven Agent Intelligence
**Smart agent selection based on historical success patterns:**

```python
# Before agent routing - learn from past successes
success_patterns = mcp__genie_memory__search_memory(
    query="successful agent routing [wish_type] [complexity]"
)

# After agent execution - store optimization insights with structured metadata
mcp__genie_memory__add_memory(
    content="AGENT SUCCESS: [Agent] handled [wish_type] perfectly with [approach] - Context: [level]% used efficiently #routing #agent-[agent-name] #complexity-[level] #success-pattern #wish-[category]"
)
```

### 🧠 Zen-Enhanced Agent Capabilities  
**Agents can leverage Zen tools for enhanced reasoning:**

```python
# Complex architectural decisions (agents call this internally)
mcp__zen__consensus(
    models=[{"model": "gemini-2.5-pro"}, {"model": "grok-4"}],
    prompt="Architectural decision for [complex system design]"
)

# Deep problem analysis (agents use for complex debugging)
mcp__zen__thinkdeep(
    model="gemini-2.5-pro", 
    problem_context="Complex issue analysis with [detailed context]"
)
```

### 📚 Research & Knowledge Integration
**Agents have direct access to knowledge resources:**

```python
# Research best practices (agents use autonomously)
mcp__search_repo_docs__get_library_docs(
    context7CompatibleLibraryID="/context7/agno",
    topic="Implementation patterns for [specific need]"
)

# Framework-specific guidance (agents query directly)
mcp__ask_repo_agent__ask_question(
    repoName="agno-agi/agno",
    question="How to implement [agent-specific pattern]?"
)
```

### 🎯 Intelligent Model Selection (Per Agent)
**Each agent optimizes model selection based on task complexity:**

| Agent | Simple Tasks | Complex Tasks | Epic Scale |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **genie-fixer** | Direct execution | + Zen debug analysis | + Multi-model consensus |
| **genie-architect** | Pattern matching | + Deep thinking | + Consensus + Research |
| **genie-security** | Known patterns | + Threat modeling | + Multi-expert validation |
