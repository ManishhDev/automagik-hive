### Component Decision Framework
- **🤖 Individual Agents**: Single domain expertise (code editing, file management, project orchestration)
- **👥 Teams**: Multi-domain coordination using `mode="route"` (intelligent routing) or `mode="coordinate"` (collaboration)
- **⚡ Workflows**: Multi-step processes with parallel execution, conditional logic, and state management
- **🏭 Factory Pattern**: Registry-based component creation with version management and hot-reload

## Agent Environment Commands

### Essential Commands for AI Agents
**🤖 LLM-optimized commands - all non-blocking, return terminal immediately:**
```bash
# First-time setup (silent, no prompts, mirror environment)
make install-agent  # Creates .env.agent, ports 38886/35532, separate DB

# Daily agent operations 
make agent          # Start server in background, show startup logs, return terminal
make agent-logs     # View logs (non-blocking, last 50 lines)
make agent-restart  # Clean restart sequence  
make agent-stop     # Clean shutdown with PID management
make agent-status   # Quick environment check

# Your isolated agent environment:
# - Agent API: http://localhost:38886
# - Agent DB: postgresql://localhost:35532  
# - Agent config: .env.agent (auto-generated from .env.example)
# - Isolated containers: hive-agents-agent, hive-postgres-agent
# - Completely separate from any user environments
```

### Agent Development Workflow
```bash
# Package management (NEVER use python directly - always use uv)
uv sync                           # Install dependencies when needed
uv run ruff check --fix          # Lint and fix code automatically
uv run mypy .                    # Type checking for quality assurance
uv run pytest                   # Run tests to validate functionality

# Database operations (when working with data)
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Testing commands for validation
uv run pytest tests/agents/      # Test agent functionality
uv run pytest tests/workflows/   # Test workflow orchestration  
uv run pytest tests/api/         # Test API endpoints
uv run pytest --cov=ai --cov=api --cov=lib  # With test coverage
```

## MCP Tools: Live System Control

You operate within a live, instrumented Automagik Hive system with direct control via Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. These tools enable autonomous operations on the agent instance while requiring responsible usage aligned with our development principles.

### 🛠️ Tool Arsenal

| Tool | Purpose | Status | Example Usage |
|------|---------|--------|---------------|
| `postgres` | Direct SQL queries on agent DB (port 35532) | ✅ Working | `SELECT * FROM hive.component_versions` |
| `automagik-hive` | API interactions (agents/teams/workflows) | ⚠️ Auth Required | Check `.env.agent` for `HIVE_API_KEY` |
| `automagik-forge` | Project & task management | ✅ Working | List projects, create/update tasks |
| `genie-memory` | Persistent memory across sessions | ✅ Working | 50+ existing project memories |
| `search-repo-docs` | External library docs | ✅ Working | Agno (`/context7/agno`), other dependencies |
| `ask-repo-agent` | GitHub repo Q&A | 🔧 Requires Indexing | Agno (`agno-agi/agno`), external repos |
| `wait` | Workflow delays | ✅ Working | `wait_minutes(0.1)` for async ops |
| `send_whatsapp_message` | External notifications | ✅ Working | Use responsibly for alerts |

### 🗄️ Database Schema Discovery

```sql
-- Agent instance database (postgresql://localhost:35532/hive_agent)
-- agno schema
agno.knowledge_base         -- Vector embeddings for RAG system
  ├── id, name, content    -- Core fields
  ├── embedding (vector)   -- pgvector embeddings  
  └── meta_data, filters   -- JSONB for filtering

-- hive schema  
hive.component_versions     -- All agent/team/workflow configs
  ├── component_id, type   -- Identification
  ├── version (integer)    -- Version tracking
  └── config (JSON)        -- Full YAML configuration

hive.agent_metrics         -- Performance tracking
hive.version_history       -- Change audit trail
```

### 🎯 Usage Patterns

**Sequential Approach** (optimize for efficiency):
1. Check memory first: `genie-memory` for existing context
2. Search external docs: `search-repo-docs` for Agno framework or other dependencies  
3. Query data: `postgres` for system state (read-only preferred)
4. Take actions: `automagik-forge` for tasks, `automagik-hive` when auth works

**Integration with Development Workflow**:
```bash
# Before using MCP tools, ensure agent environment is running
make agent-status    # Check if services are up
make agent-logs      # Debug any connection issues

# After tool usage that modifies configs
# CRITICAL: Bump version in YAML files per our rules
```

### 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Auth Errors (401) with automagik-hive**:
```bash
cat .env.agent | grep HIVE_API_KEY  # Verify API key exists
# If missing, check with user or use postgres as fallback
```

**Connection Failures**:
```bash
make agent-restart   # Clean restart of services
# Remember: Agent API on http://localhost:38886
```

### 🛡️ Safety Guidelines

- **postgres**: Readonly direct queries
- **genie-memory**: Add memories for important discoveries/decisions  
- **send_whatsapp_message**: Confirm recipient/content before sending
- **🚨 Version Bumping**: ANY config change via tools requires YAML version update

### 📋 Best Practices

1. **Always verify before modifying**: Query current state first
2. **Use transactions for DB changes**: `BEGIN; ... COMMIT/ROLLBACK;`
3. **Log important actions**: Store in genie-memory for audit trail
4. **Respect rate limits**: Add wait between bulk operations
5. **Fail gracefully**: Have fallback strategies (API → DB → memory)

These tools transform you from passive code assistant to active system operator. Use them wisely to accelerate development while maintaining system integrity.

## Core Development Patterns

### Development Principles
- **KISS, YAGNI, DRY**: Write simple, focused code that solves current needs without unnecessary complexity
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply where relevant, favor composition over inheritance
- **Modern Frameworks**: Use industry standard libraries over custom implementations
- **🚫 NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Always break compatibility for clean, modern implementations
- **No Mocking/Placeholders**: Never mock, use placeholders, hardcode, or omit code
- **Explicit Side Effects**: Make side effects explicit and minimal
- **Honest Assessment**: Be brutally honest about whether ideas are good or bad

### YAML-First Configuration
All components use YAML configuration with hot reload capabilities:

### Agno Framework Integration
- **Playground Pattern**: Auto-generates API endpoints via `Playground()` 
- **FastAPI Integration**: Uses Agno's `FastAPIApp()` for production deployment
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector support, automatic SQLite fallback
- **Streaming**: Real-time responses via Server-Sent Events and WebSocket

### Environment-Based Configuration
Configuration scales automatically from development to production:
- **Development**: Relaxed CORS, docs enabled, SQLite fallback
- **Production**: Strict security, API key required, PostgreSQL with connection pooling

## Key Technical Details

### Database Architecture
- **Primary**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- **Fallback**: SQLite for development
- **Migrations**: Alembic with automatic schema management
- **Connection**: Pool size 20, max overflow 30, connection recycling

### API Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI docs
- **Authentication**: API key middleware (configurable)
- **Streaming**: SSE and WebSocket support for real-time responses
- **CORS**: Environment-based origin configuration

### Knowledge Management
- **Format**: CSV-based RAG with hot reload
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with vector search capabilities
- **Filtering**: Business unit and context-aware retrieval
- **Performance**: Incremental loading with hash-based change detection


### Component Creation
```bash
# Create new components from templates
cp -r ai/agents/template-agent ai/agents/my-new-agent
cp -r ai/teams/template-team ai/teams/my-routing-team
cp -r ai/workflows/template-workflow ai/workflows/my-workflow

# CRITICAL: After copying, immediately update version in config.yaml
# Remember: ANY change requires version bump in YAML config
```

## Important Development Rules

### Automagik Hive Specific
- **Agent Development**: Always use YAML configuration files following existing architecture patterns
- **🚨 CRITICAL VERSION BUMPING**: For ANY change to agents/teams/workflows (code, config, tools, instructions), the version MUST be bumped in the YAML config file
- **Testing Required**: Every new agent must have corresponding unit and integration tests
- **Knowledge Base**: Use CSV-based RAG system with hot reload for context-aware responses
- **No Hardcoding**: Never hardcode values - always use .env files and YAML configs
- **🚫 NO LEGACY CODE**: Remove backward compatibility code immediately - clean implementations only
- **🎯 KISS Principle**: Simplify over-engineered components, eliminate redundant layers

### File Organization & Modularity
- **Small Focused Files**: Default to multiple small files (<350 lines) rather than monolithic ones
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file should have one clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate utilities, constants, types, components, and business logic
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Use inheritance only for true 'is-a' relationships
- **Clear Structure**: Follow existing project structure, create new directories when appropriate
- **Proper Imports/Exports**: Design for reusability and maintainability

### Python Development
- **Never use python directly**: Always use `uv run` for python commands
- **UV Package Management**: Use `uv add <package>` for dependencies, never pip

### Git Commit Requirements
- **📧 MANDATORY**: ALWAYS co-author commits with: `Co-Authored-By: Automagik Genie <genie@namastex.ai>`
