# üöÄ Comprehensive Agno Workflows 2.0 Refactoring Plan

## üìã Executive Summary

This plan outlines the complete refactoring strategy for our existing workflows to prepare for and eventually migrate to Agno Workflows 2.0 with step-based architecture. The plan is designed to be executed in phases, ensuring minimal disruption while maximizing the benefits of the new architecture.

## üîç Step 1: Current State Analysis

### Current Workflow Status:
- **Agno Version**: 1.7.1 (Workflows 1.0)
- **Target Version**: 1.7.4+ (Workflows 2.0 with step-based architecture)
- **Current Workflows**: 
  - Conversation Typification (1.0-modern)
  - Human Handoff (1.0-modern)

### Workflows 2.0 New Features (Based on Release Notes):
1. **Step-based Architecture**: Replace linear execution with discrete steps
2. **Flexible Execution**: Sequential, parallel, conditional, and loop-based execution
3. **Smart Routing**: Dynamic step selection based on content analysis
4. **Mixed Components**: Seamless combination of agents, teams, and functions
5. **Enhanced State Management**: Improved session state sharing across steps

## üéØ Step 2: Documentation Analysis and Pattern Identification

### Documentation URLs to Analyze:
- https://docs.agno.com/workflows_2/overview
- https://docs.agno.com/workflows_2/types_of_workflows
- https://docs.agno.com/workflows_2/run_workflow
- https://docs.agno.com/workflows_2/workflow_session_state
- https://docs.agno.com/workflows_2/advanced
- https://docs.agno.com/workflows_2/migration

### Current Linear Workflow Patterns to Transform:

#### Conversation Typification Workflow:
```python
# Current 1.0 Pattern
def run(self, conversation_text: str) -> Iterator[RunResponse]:
    # Step 1: Business Unit Classification
    business_unit = self.business_unit_agent.run(conversation_text)
    
    # Step 2: Product Classification
    product = self.product_agent.run(business_unit, conversation_text)
    
    # Step 3: Motive Classification
    motive = self.motive_agent.run(product, conversation_text)
    
    # Step 4: Submotive Classification
    submotive = self.submotive_agent.run(motive, conversation_text)
    
    # Step 5: Validation and Final Report
    final_report = self.validate_and_finalize(submotive)
    
    yield RunResponse(content=final_report)
```

#### Human Handoff Workflow:
```python
# Current 1.0 Pattern
def run(self, customer_message: str) -> Iterator[RunResponse]:
    # Step 1: Escalation Analysis
    escalation = self.analyze_escalation(customer_message)
    
    # Step 2: Generate Protocol
    protocol = self.generate_protocol(escalation)
    
    # Step 3: Send Notifications
    notifications = self.send_notifications(protocol)
    
    # Step 4: Create Final Report
    final_report = self.create_final_report(protocol, notifications)
    
    yield RunResponse(content=final_report)
```

## üîÑ Step 3: Design Step-Based Architecture Patterns

### 2.0 Step-Based Transformation Strategy:

#### Pattern 1: Sequential Steps with State Management
```python
# Future 2.0 Pattern (Conceptual)
from agno.workflow.v2 import StepBasedWorkflow, Step, StepResult

class ConversationTypificationWorkflow(StepBasedWorkflow):
    steps = [
        Step(
            name="business_unit_classification",
            agent=business_unit_agent,
            input_mapping=lambda state: state.get("conversation_text"),
            output_key="business_unit"
        ),
        Step(
            name="product_classification",
            agent=product_agent,
            input_mapping=lambda state: {
                "business_unit": state.get("business_unit"),
                "conversation_text": state.get("conversation_text")
            },
            output_key="product"
        ),
        # ... additional steps
    ]
```

#### Pattern 2: Conditional Routing Based on Content
```python
# Future 2.0 Pattern (Conceptual)
class HumanHandoffWorkflow(StepBasedWorkflow):
    def define_steps(self):
        return [
            Step(
                name="escalation_analysis",
                agent=escalation_agent,
                condition=lambda state: state.get("customer_message") is not None
            ),
            ConditionalStep(
                name="urgent_escalation",
                condition=lambda state: state.get("urgency_level") == "high",
                true_step=UrgentEscalationStep(),
                false_step=StandardEscalationStep()
            ),
            ParallelStep(
                name="notifications",
                steps=[
                    WhatsAppNotificationStep(),
                    SlackNotificationStep()
                ]
            )
