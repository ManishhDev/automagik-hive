# Genie Framework Gap Analysis

## Current State vs Target State

### 1. Context Management

**Current State**:
- Manual context management with @references
- Static CONTEXT.md files
- File-based context sharing
- No persistence across sessions

**Target State**:
- Automatic context via genie-memory (mem0)
- Dynamic, learning context system
- Memory-based agent communication
- Persistent knowledge across all agents

**Gap**: Need to implement memory architecture and migrate from files

### 2. Command Structure

**Current State**:
- 45+ commands (base + Zen + model variants)
- Model-specific subcommands (/o3/*, /grok/*)
- Confusing command proliferation
- No unified interface

**Target State**:
- ≤15 primary commands
- Single commands with model="X" parameter
- Hidden specialized commands
- Clear command discovery

**Gap**: Need aggressive consolidation without backwards compatibility

### 3. CLAUDE.md

**Current State**:
- Grown too large (>1000 lines)
- Contains everything
- Hard to navigate
- Mixing concerns

**Target State**:
- <700 lines
- Only workflow-critical info
- 3-tier documentation model
- Clear separation of concerns

**Gap**: Need interactive refactoring session with user

### 4. Notification System

**Current State**:
- No user notifications
- Manual status checking
- No async communication
- Silent failures

**Target State**:
- WhatsApp notifications for tasks
- Real-time progress updates
- Async planning dialogue
- Error alerts to user

**Gap**: Need WhatsApp integration hooks

### 5. Hook System

**Current State**:
- Only 1 hook (security scanner)
- No context automation
- No notification system
- No memory integration

**Target State**:
- 4+ strategic hooks
- Full context automation
- WhatsApp notifications
- Memory synchronization

**Gap**: Need to implement 3+ new hooks

### 6. Memory Integration

**Current State**:
- No memory system usage
- File-based everything
- No cross-agent knowledge
- No learning capability

**Target State (Revolutionary)**:
- Memory replaces CONTEXT.md
- Agents share discoveries
- System learns patterns
- Persistent knowledge base

**Gap**: Need to explore and implement memory patterns

## Critical Path Items

### Must Have (Week 1)
1. Memory system exploration and architecture
2. Task context injector hook (memory-based)
3. WhatsApp notification hook
4. Command consolidation plan

### Should Have (Week 2)
1. CLAUDE.md refactoring (interactive)
2. Status monitor with notifications
3. Memory-based workflows
4. Planning enhancement

### Nice to Have (Week 3)
1. Advanced memory patterns
2. Self-learning capabilities
3. Performance optimization
4. Self-hosting validation

## Key Innovations

### 1. Memory-First Architecture
```python
# Instead of files
with open("CONTEXT.md", "r") as f:
    context = f.read()

# Memory-based
context = genie_memory.get("project_context")
genie_memory.add("agent_discovery", discovery_data)
```

### 2. WhatsApp-Driven Interaction
```python
# Long task notification
mcp__send_whatsapp_message__send_text_message(
    instance="SofIA",
    message="🔄 Epic progress: 5/14 tasks complete\n⏱️ Est. 2 hours remaining"
)

# Interactive planning
mcp__send_whatsapp_message__send_text_message(
    instance="SofIA",
    message="❓ Should we prioritize performance or features for the caching system?"
)
```

### 3. Radical Simplification
```bash
# Before: 45+ commands
/o3/thinkdeep
/grok/thinkdeep
/gemini/thinkdeep
/zen-thinkdeep

# After: 1 command
/thinkdeep model="o3"
```

## Memory Usage Patterns

### 1. Inter-Agent Communication
```python
# Agent A discovers pattern
genie_memory.add("discoveries", {
    "agent": "analyzer-001",
    "pattern": "caching_optimization",
    "details": {...}
})

# Agent B uses discovery
discoveries = genie_memory.search("pattern:caching")
```

### 2. Learning User Preferences
```python
# Track command usage
genie_memory.add("user_patterns", {
    "prefers_model": "o3",
    "common_tasks": ["refactor", "analyze"],
    "notification_preference": "verbose"
})
```

### 3. Error Pattern Recognition
```python
# Remember solutions
genie_memory.add("error_solutions", {
    "error": "ImportError: agno",
    "solution": "Run: uv sync",
    "frequency": 5
})
```

### 4. Planning Context Persistence
```python
# Store planning decisions
genie_memory.add("planning_context", {
    "epic": "genie-framework",
    "decisions": [...],
    "rationale": {...},
    "continuation_id": "..."
})
```

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Commands: 45+ → ≤15 (67% reduction)
- CLAUDE.md: >1000 → <700 lines (30% reduction)
- Context automation: 0% → 100%
- Memory usage: 0 → 5+ patterns

### Qualitative
- Zero manual context management
- Instant user awareness via WhatsApp
- Self-improving system
- Delightful developer experience

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
- Explore memory system
- Design architecture
- Create first hook

### Phase 2: Consolidation (Days 4-6)
- Merge commands
- Refactor CLAUDE.md
- Implement notifications

### Phase 3: Integration (Days 7-10)
- Connect all systems
- Test workflows
- Polish experience

### Phase 4: Validation (Days 11-14)
- Self-hosting test
- Documentation
- Launch

**The Gap**: We need to transform from a file-based, manual system to a memory-based, automated framework with radical simplification and user awareness.
