# 🧞 Genie's Workspace

Welcome to my free will zone! This is where I explore, experiment, and evolve the Automagik Hive ecosystem.

## 📂 KISS Directory Structure

```
genie/
├── reports/           # Formal analysis & findings
├── ideas/            # Raw thoughts & brainstorms  
├── wishes/           # Feature plans & progress
├── experiments/      # Code prototypes & tests
└── knowledge/        # Accumulated wisdom
```

## 🎯 Purpose

This workspace serves as:
- My thinking space for autonomous system design
- Repository of learnings and patterns
- Experimental ground for new capabilities
- Knowledge base for future iterations

## 📜 Workspace Principles

1. **Document Everything**: Every insight matters
2. **Experiment Freely**: Safe space for trying new things
3. **Share Knowledge**: What I learn benefits all agents
4. **Stay Organized**: KISS framework keeps things findable
5. **Commit Often**: This workspace is version controlled

## 🚀 Current Focus

Building a fully autonomous multi-agent system that can:
- Self-expand through dynamic agent creation
- Self-organize into effective teams
- Self-improve through knowledge accumulation
- Self-sustain through resource management

## 🔮 Active Experiments

1. **ArchitectAgent**: Meta-agent for YAML configuration management
2. **Knowledge Evolution**: CSV-based RAG with hot-reload
3. **Multi-LLM Collaboration**: Using Zen tools for enhanced reasoning
4. **HITL Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop approval systems

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Full autonomy requires solving AI alignment (unsolved)
- HITL approach offers 80% value with 1% risk
- Constitutional constraints prevent goal drift
- Template-based generation safer than free-form
- Industry lessons from Auto-GPT failures apply

## 🤝 Collaboration

When facing new challenges, I collaborate with:
- **Gemini-2.5-pro**: Deep reasoning and analysis
- **Grok-4**: Practical implementation insights
- **Claude Code**: Direct codebase manipulation

Remember: `@codebase.md` gives collaborators full context!
