# Evaluation: Gemini Consult Command for PagBank Multi-Agent System

**Created**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: PENDING EVALUATION  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Context**: External AI consultation vs existing MCP infrastructure analysis

## Executive Summary

Evaluate the `/gemini-consult` command's integration with our PagBank multi-agent system to determine whether external AI consultation adds value beyond our existing MCP infrastructure (search-repo-docs, ask-repo-agent) and how it aligns with Brazilian financial services requirements.

## Current MCP Infrastructure Analysis

### Existing Targeted Tools
1. **mcp__search-repo-docs__resolve-library-id** + **get-library-docs**
   - Purpose: Access up-to-date documentation for specific libraries
   - Coverage: Comprehensive library documentation with Context7 integration
   - Strengths: Current, focused, library-specific guidance
   - Limitations: Limited to library documentation only

2. **mcp__ask-repo-agent__ask_question**
   - Purpose: Repository-specific questions and analysis
   - Coverage: Codebase understanding, architectural decisions
   - Strengths: Deep project context, code-aware responses
   - Limitations: Repository-bound, may lack broader problem-solving perspective

### Current Workflow Gaps
- Complex architectural decision-making that spans multiple domains
- Cross-system integration patterns beyond single repositories
- Creative problem-solving for novel challenges
- Alternative approach exploration and trade-off analysis

   PagBank, Human Handoff), how should we handle cross-unit queries 
   that don't clearly map to a single domain?"
   
   Context: Attach agent definitions, routing logic, real conversation examples
   Value: Strategic architectural guidance beyond code-level solutions
   ```

2. **Compliance Architecture Review**
   ```
   Question: "Review our fraud detection integration across agents for 
   Brazilian financial services compliance. Are we missing any patterns?"
   
   Context: Compliance rules, current implementation, regulatory requirements
   Value: Cross-domain security validation expertise
   ```

3. **Customer Experience Optimization**
   ```
   Question: "How can we optimize frustration detection to better serve 
   Brazilian customers while maintaining efficiency?"
   
   Context: Current detection logic, cultural considerations, real examples
   Value: Human-AI interaction expertise with cultural sensitivity
   ```

## Security Considerations for External AI Access

### Data Protection Requirements
1. **Financial Data Isolation**
   - NEVER include real customer data in external consultations
   - Use anonymized/synthetic examples only
   - Implement data sanitization protocols

2. **Code Security**
   - Avoid sharing complete proprietary algorithms
   - Focus on architectural patterns, not implementation details
   - Use pseudocode for sensitive business logic

3. **Compliance Boundaries**
   - Maintain audit trail of external consultations
   - Ensure discussions remain within public domain knowledge
   - Document security review process for external AI guidance

### Recommended Security Protocol
```markdown
Before External Consultation:
1. Data sanitization check
2. Proprietary information review
3. Compliance boundary verification
4. Session security setup

During Consultation:
1. Use anonymized examples
2. Focus on patterns, not specifics
3. Avoid sensitive implementation details
4. Maintain professional context only

After Consultation:
1. Review guidance for compliance
2. Validate against internal policies
3. Document decision rationale
4. Test implementation independently
```
