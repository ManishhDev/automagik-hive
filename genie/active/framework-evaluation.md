# Task: Framework Evaluation - Real-World Testing

## Epic: genie-framework-completion
## Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
## Dependencies: None

## Description
Conduct comprehensive real-world testing of the Genie framework to evaluate performance, identify bottlenecks, and document improvements. This is our TRACK 4 objective to test command system, memory patterns, multi-agent coordination, and hook integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test all 16 consolidated commands with model parameters (updated from 14)
- [ ] Evaluate memory pattern effectiveness (PATTERN, TASK, FOUND)
- [ ] Monitor multi-agent coordination capabilities
- [ ] Validate hook system (task-context-injector.sh)
- [ ] Test context tools integration (/search-docs, /ask-repo) âœ… COMPLETED
- [ ] Document performance metrics and bottlenecks
- [ ] Create actionable improvement recommendations
- [ ] Measure framework readiness for production use

## Evaluation Targets

### 1. Command Performance Testing
**Commands to Test**: 
- Core (5): /wish, /planner, /epic, /spawn-tasks, /context
- Development (7): /analyze, /debug, /review, /chat, /thinkdeep, /test, /refactor  
- Documentation (2): /docs, /full-context
- Context Tools (2): /search-docs, /ask-repo âœ… VERIFIED

**Metrics**: Response quality, speed, model parameter effectiveness
**Test Scenarios**: 
- Code analysis tasks with different models (o3, grok, gemini)
- Complex debugging scenarios
- Multi-step review workflows
- Context tool integration with Agno framework âœ… COMPLETED

### 2. Memory System Effectiveness  
**Patterns to Test**: PATTERN, TASK, FOUND prefixes
**Scenarios**:
- Cross-agent context sharing
- Pattern discovery and reuse
- Knowledge persistence across sessions
- Memory search performance

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination
**Test Areas**:
- Parallel task execution
- Dependency management
- Status synchronization
- Conflict resolution

### 4. Hook System Validation
**Components**:
- task-context-injector.sh effectiveness
- MCP security scanning
- Context automation

## Implementation Notes

### Testing Methodology
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Document current framework state
2. **Systematic Testing**: Execute each command type with monitoring
3. **Performance Tracking**: Record response times, quality metrics
4. **Issue Documentation**: Log bottlenecks, failures, improvements needed
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Create actionable enhancement plan

### Performance Metrics
- Command response time (by model)
- Memory search efficiency
- Context injection effectiveness
- Agent coordination success rate
- Framework usability score

### Test Sequence
1. Command system evaluation (5 core + 7 development + 2 docs + 2 context) âœ… Context tools done
2. Memory pattern testing across multiple scenarios
3. Multi-agent coordination simulation
4. Hook system validation âœ… MCP security scanning verified
5. Integration testing with real development tasks

## Real-World Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multi-Model Command Testing
Test `/analyze` with different models on the same codebase section
- Model: o3 (logical analysis)
- Model: grok (creative insights) 
- Model: gemini (deep reasoning)
Compare output quality, speed, and effectiveness

### Scenario 2: Memory-Based Agent Coordination
Simulate multiple agents working on related tasks
- Agent A: Analyzes auth system, writes findings to memory
- Agent B: Searches memory for auth patterns, implements tests
- Agent C: Reviews implementation using memory context
Test knowledge flow and coordination

### Scenario 3: Context Injection Validation
Test automatic context injection with task-context-injector.sh
- Measure context relevance and completeness
- Validate security scanning effectiveness
- Check performance impact

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive framework performance report
- Bottleneck identification and solutions
- Command system optimization recommendations
- Memory pattern effectiveness analysis
- Multi-agent coordination improvements
- Production readiness assessment

## Next Steps After Evaluation
Based on findings, prioritize:
1. Critical performance improvements
2. Command system enhancements
3. Memory optimization
4. Agent coordination refinements
5. Hook system improvements
