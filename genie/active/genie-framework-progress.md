# Genie Framework Progress Update

## Date: 2025-07-14
## Epic: genie-framework-completion

## Completed Tasks

### T-001: Memory Exploration ✅
- Tested genie-memory read/write capabilities
- User confirmed subagents CAN write (my tests showed failures)
- Created memory-exploration-findings.md with patterns
- Updated understanding to memory-first approach

### T-003: Task Context Injector ✅
- Created task-context-injector.sh hook
- Successfully tested with Task tool interception
- Automatically injects CLAUDE.md and ai-context references
- Includes memory search instructions

### T-004: Command Consolidation ✅
- Reduced from 45+ commands to 14 commands
- Removed all model-specific subdirectories (o3/, grok/)
- Created unified commands with model parameter:
  - analyze.md, debug.md, chat.md, thinkdeep.md, test.md
- Merged documentation commands into docs.md
- Created consolidate-commands.sh script

## In Progress

### T-002: Memory Architecture Design
- Need to design complete memory schema
- Plan migration from CONTEXT.md files
- Define memory patterns for agents

### T-005: CLAUDE.md Refactoring
- Requires interactive session with user
- Target: <700 lines (currently much larger)
- Need to move content to ai-context/ files

### T-006: WhatsApp Notifications
- Waiting for user to fix asyncio error
- Will implement once tool is working

## Key Insights

1. **Memory System**: Full read/write for all agents (per user)
2. **Command Simplification**: Successfully reduced to 14 commands
3. **Context Automation**: Hook working perfectly
4. **Simple is Better**: User emphasized memory should SIMPLIFY workflow

## Next Actions

1. Design memory architecture (T-002)
2. Wait for user availability for CLAUDE.md refactoring (T-005)
3. Test WhatsApp when fixed (T-006)
4. Continue with remaining tasks per epic plan
