# Manual Security Testing Log - MCP Tools

## Objective
Test each MCP tool to understand security implications and file handling before implementing CCDK hooks.

## Test Results

### 1. Gemini Assistant MCP Tool Test
**Status**: ‚ùå **NOT ACCESSIBLE** 
- **Tool Name**: `consult_gemini` (configured as "gemini-consult" in .mcp.json)
- **Issue**: Tool not available in current session
- **Configuration**: Present in .mcp.json with API key
- **Next Steps**: Need session restart or environment setup

**Security Concerns Identified**:
- **API Key Exposure**: Visible in .mcp.json file (should be in environment)
- **File Upload Risk**: Tool can upload actual code files to external Gemini API
- **No Sanitization**: No current protection against PII/financial data leakage

### 2. Search-Repo-Docs MCP Tool Test  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING**
- **Tool Name**: `mcp__search-repo-docs__resolve-library-id`
- **Function**: External library documentation lookup
- **Security**: Lower risk - only searches public documentation
- **Data Sent**: Library names and search queries only

### 3. Ask-Repo-Agent MCP Tool Test
**Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY RISK CONFIRMED**
- **Tool Name**: `mcp__ask-repo-agent__ask_question`
- **Configuration**: SSE connection to external service (https://mcp.deepwiki.com/sse)
- **Function**: Sends detailed questions about codebases to external AI service
- **Security Risk**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED** - Can send sensitive questions about our financial codebase
- **Test Result**: Successfully sent question about "sensitive information in financial services codebase"
- **Response**: Detailed analysis about security considerations in multi-agent systems

## Critical Security Findings

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Gemini Assistant File Uploads**
   - Can upload entire code files to Google's servers
   - No current scanning for PII, API keys, financial data
   - Session management stores file content

2. **API Key Management**
   - Keys stored in .mcp.json instead of secure environment
   - Visible in plaintext in configuration files

3. **Financial Data Exposure**
   - No protection against sending account numbers, CPF, financial algorithms
   - Brazilian LGPD compliance at risk

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **MCP Security Scanner** - CRITICAL priority
2. **Environment Variable Migration** - Move API keys out of .mcp.json
3. **File Content Scanning** - Before any uploads to external services

## Next Steps
1. Get Gemini Assistant working to test actual file upload mechanism
2. Test ask-repo-agent with sensitive data patterns
3. Implement security scanning before proceeding with hooks
4. Document exact data flow for each MCP tool

## Testing Commands to Run
```bash
# Test Gemini with sensitive data (AFTER security scanner)
/consult_gemini "analyze this payment processing code" 
# Include mock financial data to test scanning

# Test ask-repo-agent risk (COMPLETED)
mcp__ask-repo-agent__ask_question(
  repoName="agno-agi/agno",
  question="How should I implement fraud detection in a Brazilian financial services application..."
)
# ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Successfully sent detailed financial question to external service
# ‚úÖ RISK: Could easily include sensitive code context or PII details
```

## Security Risk Demonstration
Created test file: `/test-sensitive-data.py` with mock:
- API keys (fake but realistic format)
- Customer PII (CPF, account numbers, balances) 
- Payment processing algorithms
- Fraud detection logic

**Risk**: Any of this could be accidentally included in MCP tool calls!

## Risk Assessment
- **Current Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH** - No protection for financial data
- **Priority**: Implement security scanning before production use
- **Compliance**: LGPD violations possible without proper data protection
