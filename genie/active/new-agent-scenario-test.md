# New Agent Creation Scenario Test

## Test Scenario Overview

**Scenario**: Add a new "Insurance Specialist Agent" to handle PagBank insurance products (life insurance, auto insurance, property insurance)

**Purpose**: Validate the complete 3-tier documentation system by tracing through all context loading, creation, and routing decisions for a complex multi-component task.

## Task Analysis Phase

### Input Task Description
```
"Create a new Insurance specialist agent to handle PagBank insurance products. 
The agent should integrate with the existing routing system, have its own 
knowledge base filters, and support Portuguese customer interactions for 
life insurance, auto insurance, and property insurance inquiries."

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Successful Context Routing

1. **Foundation Context**: All Tier 1 files properly auto-injected
2. **Component Detection**: High accuracy for relevant components
3. **Smart Suggestions**: Medium confidence items properly suggested
4. **On-Demand Creation**: Clear triggers for Tier 3 documentation
5. **Pattern Reuse**: Existing patterns properly referenced

### 🔍 Areas for Enhancement

1. **Context Caching**: Could improve load times for repeated contexts
2. **Relevance Pruning**: Could skip irrelevant sections of large files
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Could better track which Tier 3 docs depend on Tier 2
4. **Pattern Discovery**: Could suggest more existing patterns to reference

### 📋 Recommendations

1. **Implement Context Caching**: Cache frequently loaded Tier 2 contexts
2. **Add Relevance Scoring**: Score sections within files for targeted loading
3. **Create Missing Contexts**: Add Tier 2 CONTEXT.md files for major components
4. **Enhance Pattern Library**: Build more reusable patterns in /genie/reference/

## Conclusion

The new agent creation scenario demonstrates that the 3-tier context injection system effectively:

1. **Automatically loads stable foundation context** (Tier 1)
2. **Intelligently detects relevant component context** (Tier 2)  
3. **Creates precise feature context on-demand** (Tier 3)
4. **Maintains performance within acceptable limits**
5. **Provides clear routing for complex multi-component tasks**

The system is ready for production use and demonstrates sophisticated context management for AI-assisted multi-agent development.
