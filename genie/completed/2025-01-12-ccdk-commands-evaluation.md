### 7. `/handoff` - Session Context Preservation
**Purpose**: Preserve context for session continuity
**Complexity**: Low - Documentation updates with state preservation
**Key Features**:
- Session achievement tracking
- Current state documentation
- Next steps preservation
- Context limit handling

**PagBank Relevance**: ðŸ”¥ **MEDIUM** - Nice to have for epic continuity

### 8. `/hook-setup` - Hook System Testing
**Purpose**: Hook installation verification and testing
**Complexity**: Medium - Multi-agent orchestration for testing
**Key Features**:
- Installation verification
- Configuration checking
- Comprehensive testing
- Multi-agent test coordination

**PagBank Relevance**: ðŸ”¥ **LOW** - Implementation detail

## Evaluation Criteria

### Immediate Value for PagBank
- **Customer Query Analysis**: How well does it support multi-business-unit scenarios?
- **Compliance Integration**: Does it support financial services requirements?
- **Portuguese Support**: Can it handle language validation requirements?
- **Epic Coordination**: Does it fit our kanban workflow?

### Technical Integration
- **Genie Compatibility**: How does it work with our existing framework?
- **Agno Integration**: Does it leverage our Agno patterns?
- **MCP Adaptation**: Can we adapt for search-repo/ask-repo tools?
- **Context Management**: How does it work with our contextual CLAUDE.md files?

### Implementation Complexity
- **Adaptation Effort**: How much work to adapt for PagBank?
- **Maintenance Burden**: Ongoing maintenance requirements?
- **Learning Curve**: Team adoption complexity?
- **Risk Level**: Implementation and operational risks?

## Decision Points for Discussion

### Priority 1: Core Commands (High Value)
**Commands**: `/full-context`, `/code-review`, `/update-docs`, `/refactor`

**Questions for Discussion**:
1. Should we adapt `/full-context` for customer query analysis across business units?
2. How should `/code-review` integrate with our compliance requirements?
3. Should `/update-docs` manage our contextual CLAUDE.md files?
4. Is `/refactor` valuable for our V2 architecture work?

### Priority 2: Supporting Commands (Medium Value)  
**Commands**: `/gemini-consult`, `/create-docs`, `/handoff`

**Questions for Discussion**:
1. Do we need `/gemini-consult` when we have search-repo/ask-repo?
2. Should `/create-docs` enhance our existing documentation?
3. Is `/handoff` useful for epic continuity in our kanban workflow?

### Priority 3: Utility Commands (Low Value)
**Commands**: `/hook-setup`

**Questions for Discussion**:
1. Do we need specialized setup commands or handle differently?

## Adaptation Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Priority Commands
- Adapt `/full-context` â†’ `/customer-analysis` for PagBank scenarios
- Adapt `/code-review` â†’ `/compliance-review` with financial services focus
- Adapt `/update-docs` â†’ `/update-genie-docs` for our structure
- Adapt `/refactor` â†’ Keep as-is with PagBank context

### Phase 2: Supporting Commands
- Evaluate `/gemini-consult` vs our existing MCP tools
- Enhance `/create-docs` for our contextual system
- Adapt `/handoff` â†’ `/epic-handoff` for kanban workflow

### Phase 3: PagBank-Specific Commands
- Create `/business-impact` - Cross-unit impact analysis
- Create `/portuguese-review` - Language and cultural validation
- Create `/escalation-analysis` - Human handoff decision support

## Implementation Notes

### Command Location
```bash
# Copy and adapt commands to:
.claude/commands/
â”œâ”€â”€ customer-analysis.md        # Adapted from full-context.md
â”œâ”€â”€ compliance-review.md        # Adapted from code-review.md  
â”œâ”€â”€ update-genie-docs.md       # Adapted from update-docs.md
â”œâ”€â”€ intelligent-refactor.md    # Adapted from refactor.md
â”œâ”€â”€ business-impact.md         # NEW: PagBank-specific
â”œâ”€â”€ portuguese-review.md       # NEW: Language validation
â””â”€â”€ epic-handoff.md           # Adapted from handoff.md
```

### Context Integration
- Auto-inject genie/ai-context/ files instead of docs/ai-context/
- Include business unit context for all commands
- Add Portuguese language validation
- Include compliance checking for financial services

### MCP Tool Adaptation
- Replace Context7 calls with search-repo-docs
- Replace ask-repo calls with ask-repo-agent  
- Keep Gemini consultation patterns where valuable
- Add PagBank-specific external consultation needs

## Next Steps

1. **Review with stakeholder** - Discuss priority and adaptation decisions
2. **Detailed analysis** - Deep dive into chosen commands
3. **Adaptation planning** - Create specific implementation plans
4. **Integration testing** - Test with existing genie framework
5. **Documentation** - Update genie documentation with new capabilities
