# Evaluation: Refactor Command Adaptation for PagBank Multi-Agent System

## Objective
Evaluate and adapt the CCDK `/refactor` command for the PagBank multi-agent financial services system, considering Agno framework patterns, business unit isolation, and our V2 architecture evolution needs.

## Current System Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: Agno (not traditional TypeScript/JavaScript)
- **Language**: Python with FastAPI serving
- **Structure**: Multi-agent orchestration with specialist business units
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLite fallback (Agno managed)
- **Business Units**: Adquirência, Emissão, PagBank, Human Handoff

### Key Components for Refactoring Consideration

```

## Adaptation Requirements

### 1. Agno Framework Pattern Compliance

**Current CCDK Assumptions vs Agno Reality:**
- **CCDK**: TypeScript/JavaScript with import/export
- **Agno**: Python with Agno-specific agent inheritance
- **CCDK**: Directory-based modules
- **Agno**: Agent-based composition with framework abstractions

**Required Adaptations:**
```python
# Agno Agent Pattern Recognition
class SpecialistAgent(BaseSpecialistAgent):
    def __init__(self, business_unit: BusinessUnit):
        super().__init__(
            agent_name=f"{business_unit.value} Specialist",
            knowledge_filter={"business_unit": business_unit.value}
        )
```

### 2. Multi-Agent System Specific Considerations

**Business Unit Isolation Requirements:**
- Each refactoring must preserve business unit boundaries
- Knowledge filters must remain intact during splitting
- Agent configurations should not cross-pollinate
- Routing logic updates need comprehensive impact analysis

**Agent Dependency Mapping:**
```
orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py
├── Imports: all specialists/*_agent.py
├── Depends: routing_logic.py, human_handoff_detector.py
└── Impacts: Any specialist refactoring affects main coordination

specialists/base_agent.py
├── Extended by: All specialist agents
├── Core abstraction: Cannot be split without major impact
└── Refactoring strategy: Extend, never split base patterns
```

### 3. V2 Architecture Evolution Integration

**Current V2 Migration Context:**
- Moving toward versioned agent architecture
- Enhanced typification workflow implementation
- Improved monitoring and observability
- Database schema evolution with Agno abstractions

**Refactoring Alignment with V2:**
- Support agent versioning during refactoring
- Maintain backward compatibility during transitions
- Consider typification hierarchy in agent splits
- Preserve monitoring integration points

### 4. Python/FastAPI Specific Adaptations

**Import Management Strategy:**
```python
# Current pattern
from agents.specialists.pagbank_agent import PagBankAgent
from context.knowledge.csv_knowledge_base import PagBankCSVKnowledgeBase

# Post-refactoring considerations
# - Absolute imports preservation
# - Agno framework import validation
# - FastAPI route dependency updates
# - Configuration file synchronization
```

**Database Schema Considerations:**
- Agno handles database abstractions automatically
- Session storage schemas managed by framework
- Agent configuration persistence
- Knowledge base table relationships

### 5. Financial Services Compliance Requirements

**Critical Compliance Preservation:**
- PII data handling patterns must remain intact
- Audit trail generation cannot be disrupted
- Fraud detection keywords and routing logic
- Regulatory compliance validation chains

**Business Logic Isolation:**
- Payment processing logic (PagBank)
- Card management operations (Emissão)
- Merchant services workflows (Adquirência)
- Human escalation procedures (Human Handoff)

## Proposed Refactor Command Adaptations

### 1. Strategy Decision Matrix for Agno Agents

**Direct Refactoring Criteria:**
- Single business unit agent improvements
- Utility function extractions within same domain
- Configuration splits that don't affect routing
- Simple prompt template reorganization

**Focused Analysis Criteria:**
- Cross-business unit import analysis needed
- Agent base class extensions or modifications
- Knowledge filter reorganization
- Database schema implications

**Comprehensive Analysis Criteria:**
- Orchestrator component modifications
- Base agent pattern changes
- Multi-agent communication protocol updates
- Framework integration pattern modifications

### 2. Agent-Specific Investigation Areas

**Agno Framework Analysis Agent:**
```
Task: "Analyze Agno framework compliance patterns for refactoring [TARGET_FILE]"

Investigation Steps:
1. Validate agent inheritance patterns
2. Check framework-managed database dependencies
3. Verify configuration schema compatibility
4. Assess impact on Agno's automatic features
```

**Business Unit Isolation Agent:**
```
Task: "Analyze business unit boundary preservation for [TARGET_FILE]"

Investigation Steps:
1. Map knowledge filter dependencies
2. Validate routing logic integrity
3. Check compliance rule preservation
4. Assess cross-unit communication impacts
```

**V2 Architecture Alignment Agent:**
```
Task: "Analyze V2 architecture evolution compatibility for [TARGET_FILE]"

Investigation Steps:
1. Check versioning strategy alignment
2. Validate typification workflow integration
3. Assess monitoring enhancement compatibility
4. Verify backward compatibility maintenance
```

### 3. Refactoring Value Assessment for Financial Services

**Positive Indicators (Financial Services Context):**
- Improves business unit separation and compliance
- Reduces risk of cross-contamination between financial domains
- Enhances audit trail clarity and maintenance
- Simplifies regulatory compliance validation
- Aligns with PCI DSS and financial data protection requirements
- Improves testability of critical financial workflows

**Negative Indicators (Financial Services Context):**
- Could introduce security vulnerabilities through exposed interfaces
- Might compromise audit trail integrity
- Reduces clarity of financial transaction flows
- Could violate financial services compliance patterns
- Introduces unnecessary complexity in critical payment paths
- Fragments business logic that should remain cohesive for regulatory reasons

### 4. Execution Strategy for Multi-Agent Systems

**File Creation Order (Agno Pattern):**
1. **Agent configuration validation** - Ensure configs remain consistent
2. **Business unit agent updates** - Maintain isolation boundaries
3. **Orchestrator integration** - Update routing and coordination
4. **Knowledge base synchronization** - Preserve filtering integrity
5. **Test coverage updates** - Maintain financial workflow validation

**Import/Export Management (Python/Agno):**
- Update `__init__.py` files for package structure
- Validate Agno agent registration patterns
- Preserve FastAPI route dependencies
- Maintain configuration file relationships
- Update test imports and mock configurations

## Implementation Testing Strategy

### 1. Business Unit Integration Tests
```python
# Test agent isolation after refactoring
def test_business_unit_isolation_post_refactor():
    # Verify no cross-contamination of knowledge filters
    # Validate routing integrity
    # Check compliance rule preservation

# Test orchestrator functionality
def test_orchestrator_routing_post_refactor():
    # Verify all business units still accessible
    # Check human handoff paths remain intact
    # Validate frustration detection accuracy
```

### 2. Financial Workflow Validation
```python
# Test critical financial paths
def test_payment_workflows_integrity():
    # PIX operations (PagBank)
    # Card management (Emissão) 
    # Merchant services (Adquirência)
    # Human escalation (Human Handoff)

# Test compliance preservation
def test_compliance_patterns_intact():
    # PII handling validation
    # Audit trail generation
    # Fraud detection keyword preservation
```

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### High Risk Areas
1. **Orchestrator modifications** - Central coordination point
2. **Base agent changes** - Affects all specialist agents
3. **Knowledge base restructuring** - Core data access patterns
4. **Database schema impacts** - Agno-managed persistence

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Individual specialist agent refactoring** - Business unit isolated
2. **Prompt template reorganization** - Agent behavior modifications
3. **Configuration file restructuring** - Deployment and runtime impacts

### Low Risk Areas
1. **Utility function extraction** - Domain-specific helpers
2. **Test file reorganization** - Development environment only
3. **Documentation restructuring** - No runtime impact

2. **Create Refactor Strategy Templates**: Develop Agno-specific refactoring patterns
3. **Build Test Harness**: Comprehensive validation for multi-agent refactoring
4. **Implement Pilot Refactoring**: Test on low-risk specialist agent component
5. **Document Patterns**: Store successful patterns in `genie/reference/`

## Conclusion

The CCDK refactor command provides an excellent foundation but requires significant adaptation for our Agno-based multi-agent financial services system. Key focus areas include preserving business unit isolation, maintaining compliance patterns, and ensuring compatibility with our V2 architecture evolution. The adapted command should prioritize financial services security and regulatory compliance over pure code organization benefits.
