# Genie Workspace Framework (KISS)

Simple workspace for development tasks. Keep it clean.

## 📁 Structure

```
genie/
├── active/          # Current work (MAX 5 files)
├── completed/       # Done work (date-prefixed)
└── reference/       # Important docs to keep
```

## 📝 Rules

1. **Active work** → `active/` folder
2. **Done work** → `completed/` with date (YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md)
3. **Keep forever** → `reference/` folder

## 🏷️ File Names

- Tasks: `task-[what].md`
- Analysis: `analysis-[what].md` 
- Plans: `plan-[what].md`

## ✅ Workflow

1. Create in `active/`
2. Work on it
3. Move to `completed/` when done
4. Keep `active/` under 5 files

That's it. Simple.
