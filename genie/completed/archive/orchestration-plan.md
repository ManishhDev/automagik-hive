```yaml
context_references:
  - Current phase status
  - Dependency requirements
  - Completion criteria
  - Integration requirements
  - Next phase blockers
```

### Agent Status Tracking

current_phase: "PHASE_1_COMPLETE - READY_FOR_PHASE_2"
completed_agents:
  - Agent A: Infrastructure Setup [STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED]
  - Agent B: Knowledge Base Development [STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED] 
  - Agent C: Memory System Foundation [STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED]

## Agent Coordination Rules

### Phase Execution Rules
1. **NO AGENT STARTS** until previous phase is 100% complete
2. **ALL AGENTS IN PHASE** must complete before next phase begins
3. **INTEGRATION TESTS** must pass before phase transition
4. **HANDOFF DOCUMENTATION** required between dependent agents

### Context Maintenance
- Each agent must reference orchestration plan at start
- Status updates must reference current phase
- Completion reports must confirm gate criteria
- Integration issues must reference dependency chain

This orchestration plan ensures proper sequencing while maintaining context throughout the development process.
