# Task: Create New Orchestration Patterns

## Objective
Implement new orchestration patterns to prevent future dead code generation and improve development coordination.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Quality improvement for future development cycles**

## Instructions

### 1. Analyze Current Dead Code Issues
- [x] 800+ lines of dead code identified
- [x] Root cause: "Build First, Integrate Never" pattern
- [x] Missing integration validation phase
- [x] No shared code registry between agents

### 2. Design Integration-First Patterns
```python
# File: orchestrator/integration_patterns.py
class IntegrationFirstOrchestrator:
    """
    New orchestration pattern that validates integration before code generation
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.code_registry = {}
        self.usage_tracker = {}
        
    def validate_integration_before_build(self, component, dependencies):
        """Validate all dependencies exist before building"""
        pass
        
    def track_code_usage(self, function_name, caller):
        """Track which code is actually used"""
        pass
        
    def cleanup_unused_code(self):
        """Remove code that's never been called"""
        pass
```

### 3. Implement Code Usage Validation
- [ ] Create shared code registry system
- [ ] Add integration validation phase
- [ ] Implement usage tracking
- [ ] Create automated cleanup phase

### 4. Create Development Guidelines
```markdown
# New Development Pattern

## Phase 1: Integration Planning
1. Identify all required integrations
2. Validate dependencies exist
3. Create integration contracts

## Phase 2: Coordinated Development
1. Build with integration points defined
2. Validate usage as code is created
3. Track dependencies in real-time

## Phase 3: Integration Validation
1. Test all integration points
2. Remove unused code immediately
3. Validate cross-component usage

## Phase 4: Cleanup
1. Remove any orphaned code
2. Validate all functions are used
3. Document integration patterns
```

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Integration-first orchestrator implemented
- [ ] Code usage tracking system
- [ ] Automated cleanup patterns
- [ ] Development guidelines documented
- [ ] Prevention patterns tested

## Dependencies
- Current codebase analysis (complete)
- Dead code identification (complete)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] New patterns prevent dead code generation
- [ ] Integration validation catches missing dependencies
- [ ] Usage tracking identifies unused code
- [ ] Cleanup phase removes orphaned functions
- [ ] Guidelines prevent "build first" anti-pattern

## Notes
- This is a quality improvement for future development
- Prevents repetition of the 800+ dead code issue
- Implements lessons learned from current project
