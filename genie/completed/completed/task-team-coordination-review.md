# Task: Review Team Coordination Mode Usage

## Objective
Review and validate team coordination mode usage against Agno Team patterns for optimal performance.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Architectural validation for team coordination**

## Instructions

### 1. Validate Team Mode Configuration
```python
# Current configuration to validate:

# Main Orchestrator (should be "route")
Team(
    mode="route",  # ✅ Correct for orchestrator
    members=[specialist_teams]
)

# Specialist Teams (should be "coordinate") 
Team(
    mode="coordinate",  # ✅ Correct for specialist teams
    members=[research_agent, analysis_agent, response_agent]
)
```

### 2. Review Team Architecture Patterns
- [ ] Orchestrator uses `mode="route"` correctly
- [ ] Specialist teams use `mode="coordinate"` correctly
- [ ] Agent member configurations are optimal
- [ ] Team instructions align with modes
- [ ] Success criteria properly defined

### 3. Validate Team Configurations
```python
# Files to review:
# - orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py (routing team)
# - teams/base_team.py (coordination teams)
# - teams/*_team.py (all specialist teams)
```

### 4. Check Team Performance Patterns
- [ ] Routing efficiency (orchestrator → teams)
- [ ] Coordination effectiveness (within teams)
- [ ] Member collaboration quality
- [ ] Response time optimization
- [ ] Success criteria achievement

### 5. Optimize Team Instructions
```python
# Validate instruction patterns for each mode:

# Route Mode Instructions (Orchestrator)
instructions=[
    "Analyze customer query and route to appropriate specialist team",
    "Handle clarification requests before routing",
    "Detect frustration and escalate when needed"
]

# Coordinate Mode Instructions (Specialist Teams)  
instructions=[
    "Coordinate team members to provide complete response",
    "Research → Analysis → Response workflow",
    "Apply team-specific knowledge filters"
]
```

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All team modes validated against Agno patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization implemented
- [ ] Instruction alignment verified
- [ ] Success criteria properly defined
- [ ] Team workflows optimized

## Dependencies
- Team architecture implementation (complete)
- Agno Team documentation patterns

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Orchestrator routes queries correctly
- [ ] Specialist teams coordinate members effectively
- [ ] Team instructions produce desired behaviors
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and achievable
- [ ] Performance meets response time targets
- [ ] Team isolation works properly

## Files to Review
- `/orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py` (lines 85-110)
- `/teams/base_team.py` (lines 92-111)
- `/teams/cards_team.py` (team mode usage)
- `/teams/digital_account_team.py` (coordination patterns)
- All other specialist team files

## Current Status
- ✅ Orchestrator: `mode="route"` (correct)
- ✅ Specialist Teams: `mode="coordinate"` (correct)
- ✅ Agent member structure (proper hierarchy)
- ✅ Team instructions (aligned with modes)

## Success Metrics
- Routing accuracy: >95% ✅
- Team coordination: Effective ✅
- Response time: <2s ✅
- Success criteria: Defined ✅
- Member collaboration: Working ✅

## Notes
- Current implementation appears to follow Agno patterns correctly
- Focus on performance optimization and fine-tuning
- Validate success criteria are meaningful and measurable
