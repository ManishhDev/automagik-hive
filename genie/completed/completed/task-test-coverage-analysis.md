# Task: Analyze Test Coverage and Critical Paths

## Objective
Analyze test coverage and identify untested critical paths in the PagBank Multi-Agent System.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Quality assurance and reliability improvement**

## Instructions

### 1. Current Test Status Assessment
```bash
# Scan for existing tests
find . -name "*test*.py" -o -name "test_*.py"

# Check test configuration
cat pyproject.toml | grep -A 10 "\[tool.pytest\]"
```

### 2. Identify Critical Paths Requiring Tests
```python
# High Priority Test Areas:

# 1. Core Orchestration
- Main orchestrator routing logic
- Team selection algorithms
- Clarification handling
- Frustration detection

# 2. Knowledge Base Operations
- Team-specific filtering
- Search performance
- Vector database integration
- CSV knowledge loading

# 3. Memory System
- Pattern detection accuracy
- Session persistence
- User memory retrieval
- Cross-team isolation

# 4. Specialist Teams
- Cards team fraud detection
- Credit team scam protection
- Investment compliance warnings
- Insurance benefit mentions
- Digital account PIX operations

# 5. Escalation Systems
- Technical escalation triggers
- Human handoff workflows
- Feedback collection
- Ticket creation
```

### 3. Design Test Strategy
```python
# File: tests/test_strategy.md

## Unit Tests
- Individual agent functionality
- Knowledge base search
- Memory operations
- Text normalization
- Routing logic

## Integration Tests  
- Team coordination workflows
- Orchestrator → team routing
- Memory → team integration
- Knowledge filtering per team

## System Tests
- Complete customer journey flows
- Portuguese language handling
- Performance benchmarks
- Escalation workflows
```

### 4. Create Critical Path Tests
```python
# Priority test files to create:

# tests/unit/
- test_orchestrator_routing.py
- test_knowledge_filtering.py  
- test_memory_operations.py
- test_frustration_detection.py

# tests/integration/
- test_team_coordination.py
- test_customer_journeys.py
- test_escalation_flows.py

# tests/performance/
- test_response_times.py
- test_knowledge_search.py
- test_memory_retrieval.py
```

### 5. Implement Test Infrastructure
```python
# File: conftest.py
import pytest
from knowledge.csv_knowledge_base import create_pagbank_knowledge_base
from memory.memory_manager import MemoryManager

@pytest.fixture
def knowledge_base():
    """Test knowledge base fixture"""
    return create_pagbank_knowledge_base()

@pytest.fixture  
def memory_manager():
    """Test memory manager fixture"""
    return MemoryManager(db_file="test_memory.db")
```

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage analysis complete
- [ ] Critical paths identified
- [ ] Test strategy documented
- [ ] Priority tests implemented
- [ ] Test infrastructure created
- [ ] Coverage targets defined

## Dependencies
- System implementation (complete)
- Test framework configuration

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Core orchestration logic tested
- [ ] Knowledge filtering accuracy verified
- [ ] Memory system reliability tested
- [ ] Team coordination validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Portuguese language support tested
- [ ] Escalation workflows verified

## Current Gap Analysis
```python
# Estimated test coverage: 15%
# Critical untested areas:
- Orchestrator routing: 0% coverage
- Team coordination: 0% coverage  
- Knowledge filtering: 0% coverage
- Memory operations: 0% coverage
- Frustration detection: 0% coverage
- Escalation workflows: 0% coverage
```

## Success Metrics
- Critical path coverage: >80%
- Unit test coverage: >70%
- Integration test coverage: >60%
- Performance tests: All critical paths
- Portuguese language: Full coverage
- Escalation workflows: Complete coverage

## Notes
- Current system has minimal test coverage
- Focus on critical business logic first
- Prioritize tests that catch integration issues
- Include Portuguese language edge cases
- Test performance benchmarks for demo readiness
