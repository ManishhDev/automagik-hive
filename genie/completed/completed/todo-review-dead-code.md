# Task: Identify Dead and Unused Code

## Objective
Catalog all dead, unused, or obsolete code across the PagBank Multi-Agent System to improve maintainability and performance.

## Instructions
1. **File-by-file analysis** of all Python files in:
   - `orchestrator/` directory
   - `teams/` directory
   - `memory/` directory
   - `knowledge/` directory
   - `escalation_systems/` directory
   - `feedback_human_systems/` directory
   - `config/` directory
   - `utils/` directory

2. **Identify unused imports** in each file:
   - Check which imports are never referenced
   - Look for duplicate imports
   - Find imports that could be optimized

3. **Find unused functions and classes**:
   - Functions defined but never called
   - Classes instantiated but never used
   - Methods that are never invoked

4. **Identify obsolete code patterns**:
   - Commented-out code blocks
   - Debug print statements
   - Temporary test code left in place
   - Placeholder implementations not used

5. **Check for redundant implementations**:
   - Duplicate utility functions
   - Similar classes with overlapping functionality
   - Repeated code that could be refactored

6. **Analyze test files** for:
   - Unused test fixtures
   - Obsolete test cases
   - Mock objects not used

## Completion Criteria
- Complete inventory of unused code by file
- List of safe-to-remove imports
- Catalog of redundant functions/classes
- Recommended code cleanup actions
- Estimate of code size reduction potential

## Dependencies
- All Phase 1-4 code completed
- Access to all source files in the project
