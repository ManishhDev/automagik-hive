# Task: Audit Claude Model Usage Consistency

## Objective
Ensure consistent Claude model usage across all components and validate that model selection aligns with requirements.

## Instructions
1. **Inventory all Claude model references** in:
   - `orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py`
   - `teams/base_team.py`
   - All files in `teams/` directory
   - `escalation_systems/` directory
   - `feedback_human_systems/` directory
   - Configuration files

2. **Check model consistency**:
   - Identify all Claude model IDs used
   - Verify claude-sonnet-4-20250514 vs claude-opus-4-20250514 usage
   - Check for any old model references (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
   - Validate model selection rationale

3. **Validate model requirements**:
   - Orchestrator: Should use claude-sonnet-4-20250514
   - Teams: Should use claude-opus-4-20250514
   - Escalation: Should use claude-opus-4-20250514
   - Feedback: Should use claude-opus-4-20250514

4. **Review model configuration patterns**:
   - Claude() initialization consistency
   - Model parameter settings
   - Any model-specific configurations
   - Error handling for model failures

5. **Check for hardcoded model references**:
   - Placeholder teams with old model IDs
   - Test files with incorrect models
   - Documentation mentioning wrong models
   - Configuration files with outdated models

6. **Validate model usage impact**:
   - Performance implications of model choices
   - Cost considerations for different models
   - Feature availability across models
   - Response quality differences

## Completion Criteria
- Complete inventory of all model usage
- List of inconsistencies to fix
- Validation that requirements are met
- Recommendations for model optimization
- Documentation of model selection rationale

## Dependencies
- All code files completed
- Understanding of model requirements
- Access to model configuration files
