# Task: Analyze Test Coverage

## Objective
Identify untested critical paths, assess test coverage quality, and recommend testing improvements across the PagBank Multi-Agent System.

## Instructions
1. **Inventory all test files**:
   - `tests/` directory structure
   - Test files in each component directory
   - Integration test coverage
   - Unit test completeness

2. **Analyze test coverage by component**:
   - **Orchestrator tests**: Main routing logic coverage
   - **Team tests**: Individual team functionality
   - **Memory tests**: Memory system operations
   - **Knowledge tests**: Knowledge base search and filtering
   - **Escalation tests**: Escalation system coverage
   - **Feedback tests**: Feedback collection and human mock

3. **Identify critical untested paths**:
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Edge cases in routing logic
   - Memory system failure modes
   - Knowledge base search failures
   - Team coordination failures
   - Escalation trigger scenarios

4. **Review test quality**:
   - Mock usage appropriateness
   - Test isolation and independence
   - Assertion coverage completeness
   - Test data quality and realism
   - Performance test coverage

5. **Check integration test coverage**:
   - Cross-team interaction tests
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Memory persistence tests
   - Knowledge base integration tests
   - Escalation system integration

6. **Validate test infrastructure**:
   - Test fixtures and utilities
   - Mock configurations
   - Test data management
   - Test environment setup
   - Cleanup procedures

7. **Assess test maintenance**:
   - Test code duplication
   - Outdated test scenarios
   - Brittle test dependencies
   - Test execution speed
   - Test reliability

## Completion Criteria
- Complete test coverage assessment
- List of critical untested paths
- Test quality improvement recommendations
- Integration test gaps identified
- Test infrastructure optimization suggestions

## Dependencies
- All test files completed
- Understanding of critical system paths
- Access to test execution results
