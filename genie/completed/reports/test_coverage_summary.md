### üéØ Critical Path Coverage

| Path | Description | Coverage | Status |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Orchestration | Customer query routing | 0% (0/3) | ‚ùå |
| Knowledge Retrieval | Knowledge base search | 0% (0/3) | ‚ùå |
| Memory System | User memory & patterns | 0% (0/3) | ‚ùå |
| Team Coordination | Multi-agent collaboration | 0% (0/3) | ‚ùå |
| Fraud Detection | Fraud/scam detection | 100% (2/2) | ‚úÖ |
| Escalation | Human handoff | 0% (0/3) | ‚ùå |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Untested Modules

### Priority 1 - Core System (CRITICAL)
1. **main_orchestrator.py** - Core routing logic that directs all customer queries
2. **routing_logic.py** - Team selection algorithms
3. **clarification_handler.py** - Query clarification for ambiguous requests
4. **frustration_detector.py** - Customer frustration detection

### Priority 2 - Data Systems (HIGH)
5. **csv_knowledge_base.py** - Knowledge retrieval system
6. **memory_manager.py** - Memory persistence layer
7. **pattern_detector.py** - Pattern recognition for user behavior

### Priority 3 - Team Framework (HIGH)
8. **base_team.py** - Team coordination framework
9. **escalation_manager.py** - Escalation workflow management
10. **technical_escalation_agent.py** - Technical issue handling

## üí™ Strengths

‚úÖ **Fraud Detection**: 100% coverage for credit and card teams' fraud detection
‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure**: Basic pytest setup exists
‚úÖ **Some Integration Tests**: Cross-team and infrastructure tests present

## üö® Risks & Gaps

### Critical Business Logic Untested
- **Routing Logic**: No tests for how customers are directed to teams
- **Portuguese Support**: No tests for language normalization, typos, accents
- **Memory System**: No tests for user memory persistence or pattern detection
- **Escalation**: No tests for human handoff workflows

### Missing Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Only 9.1% of modules have unit tests
- **Integration Tests**: Limited coverage of component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: No benchmarks for <2s response time requirement
- **Portuguese Edge Cases**: No tests for Brazilian Portuguese specifics

## üìã Recommended Actions

### Week 1: Critical Unit Tests
1. Create test for main orchestrator routing decisions
2. Test frustration detection thresholds and keywords
3. Test knowledge base team-specific filtering
4. Test memory persistence across sessions

### Week 2: Integration Tests
1. Test complete customer journey flows
2. Test orchestrator ‚Üí team ‚Üí response flow
3. Test escalation trigger workflows
4. Test cross-team memory isolation

### Week 3: System & Performance Tests
1. Portuguese language edge case tests
2. Performance benchmarks (<2s response)
3. Concurrent user handling tests
4. Complete demo scenario tests

## üéØ Target Metrics

- **Critical Path Coverage**: >80% (currently 16.7%)
- **Overall Unit Test Coverage**: >70% (currently 9.1%)
- **Integration Test Coverage**: >60%
- **Performance Tests**: All critical paths
- **Portuguese Language**: Full coverage

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement tests for main_orchestrator.py
2. **This Week**: Cover all critical untested modules
3. **Next Week**: Add integration tests for key workflows
4. **Demo Prep**: Ensure all demo scenarios have tests

## üí° Test Implementation Resources

- **Test Plan**: `tmp/test_implementation_plan.md`
- **Detailed Analysis**: `tmp/test_coverage_analysis.json`
- **Existing Tests**: `tests/` directory

**Note**: The system is functionally complete and working, but lacks comprehensive test coverage. This poses risks for maintenance, refactoring, and production deployment. Prioritize testing critical business logic and Portuguese language support.
