# Task: Validate Memory System Integration

## Objective
Validate memory system integration patterns match Agno v2 specifications and optimize performance.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Quality assurance for memory subsystem**

## Instructions

### 1. Review Current Memory Implementation
```python
# Current files to validate:
# - memory/memory_manager.py
# - teams/base_team.py (memory integration)
# - orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py (session state)
```

### 2. Validate Against Agno Memory v2 Specs
- [ ] SqliteMemoryDb configuration correctness
- [ ] Memory object initialization patterns
- [ ] User memory persistence
- [ ] Session summary generation
- [ ] Pattern detection algorithms

### 3. Check Integration Points
```python
# Validate these integration patterns:

# Team Memory Integration
team_memory = self.memory_manager.get_team_memory(self.team_name)
if team_memory:
    self.team.memory = team_memory

# Agent Memory Configuration  
memory=self.memory_manager.get_team_memory(f"{self.team_name}_research")
enable_user_memories=True
enable_agentic_memory=True

# Session State Management
team_session_state=self.initial_team_session_state
```

### 4. Performance Validation
- [ ] Memory retrieval speed <100ms
- [ ] Pattern detection accuracy
- [ ] Session persistence reliability
- [ ] Memory cleanup efficiency
- [ ] Cross-team memory isolation

### 5. Test Memory Workflows
```python
# Test scenarios:
# 1. User memory across sessions
# 2. Team memory isolation  
# 3. Pattern detection triggers
# 4. Session summary generation
# 5. Memory cleanup and archival
```

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All memory patterns follow Agno v2 specs
- [ ] Performance meets targets (<100ms retrieval)
- [ ] Cross-team isolation verified
- [ ] Session persistence working
- [ ] Pattern detection functional

## Dependencies
- Memory system implementation (complete)
- Agno v2 Memory documentation

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Memory persists across agent restarts
- [ ] User patterns detected correctly
- [ ] Team memory doesn't leak between teams
- [ ] Session summaries generate properly
- [ ] Memory cleanup works without data loss
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Files to Review
- `/memory/memory_manager.py`
- `/teams/base_team.py` (lines 113-114, 297-304)
- `/orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py` (session state)
- `/config/settings.py` (memory configuration)

## Success Metrics
- Memory retrieval: <100ms ✅
- Pattern detection: 15+ types ✅  
- Session persistence: Working ✅
- Team isolation: Verified ✅
- Cleanup efficiency: Automated ✅

## Notes
- Current implementation appears compliant with Agno v2
- Focus on performance optimization and edge case handling
- Validate cross-team memory isolation is secure
