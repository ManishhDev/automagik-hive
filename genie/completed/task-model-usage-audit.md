# Task: Audit Claude Model Usage Consistency

## Objective
Audit Claude model usage across all components to ensure consistency and optimal performance.

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Technical consistency and optimization**

## Instructions

### 1. Survey Current Model Usage
```python
# Expected consistent model across all components:
model = Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")

# Files to audit:
# - teams/base_team.py
# - teams/*_team.py (all 5 specialist teams)
# - orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py
# - escalation_systems/*.py
# - agents/*.py
```

### 2. Validate Model Consistency
- [ ] All components use `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- [ ] No mixed Sonnet/Opus usage
- [ ] Model configurations are identical
- [ ] Temperature settings consistent (0.1)
- [ ] Max tokens consistent (2048)

### 3. Check Model Configuration
```python
# Standard configuration to validate:
model = Claude(
    id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=2048
)
```

### 4. Review Performance Implications
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Response time consistency
- [ ] Cost optimization
- [ ] Quality consistency across teams
- [ ] Token usage efficiency

### 5. Document Model Strategy
```python
# Create model configuration centralization:

# File: config/models.py
def get_standard_claude_model():
    """Standard Claude model for all PagBank components"""
    return Claude(
        id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        temperature=0.1,
        max_tokens=2048
    )
```

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All components use identical Claude model
- [ ] No inconsistent model configurations
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Model usage documented
- [ ] Configuration centralized

## Dependencies
- All component implementations (complete)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Search all files for Claude model initialization
- [ ] Verify no Opus models in use
- [ ] Check temperature and token settings
- [ ] Validate performance consistency
- [ ] Test response quality across teams
- [ ] Confirm cost optimization

## Files to Audit
- `/teams/base_team.py` (line 87)
- `/teams/cards_team.py` (line 65)
- `/teams/digital_account_team.py`
- `/teams/investments_team.py`
- `/teams/credit_team.py` 
- `/teams/insurance_team.py`
- `/orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py`
- `/escalation_systems/technical_escalation_agent.py`

## Expected Findings
Based on original plan requirement: "Claude-4-Sonnet for all agents"

## Success Metrics
- Model consistency: 100% ✅
- Performance: Optimized ✅
- Cost efficiency: Maximized ✅
- Quality: Consistent ✅
- Configuration: Centralized ✅

## Notes
- Original plan specified Claude-4-Sonnet for all agents
- Current implementation should already be consistent
- Focus on any performance optimizations available
- Consider centralizing model configuration
