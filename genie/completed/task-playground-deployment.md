# Task: Phase 5 - Agno Playground Deployment

## Objective
Deploy the complete PagBank Multi-Agent System as an Agno Playground web interface for live demo presentation.

## Priority: HIGH
**Critical for project completion - enables live demo capability**

## Instructions

### 1. Create Main Playground File
```python
# File: playground.py
from agno.playground import Playground
from agno.storage.sqlite import SqliteStorage
from orchestrator.main_orchestrator import create_pagbank_orchestrator
from config.settings import settings

# Initialize main orchestrator with all teams
orchestrator = create_pagbank_orchestrator()

# Configure demo storage
storage = SqliteStorage(
    table_name="pagbank_demo_sessions", 
    db_file="tmp/pagbank_demo.db"
)

# Create Playground app
playground_app = Playground(agents=[orchestrator])
app = playground_app.get_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    playground_app.serve("playground:app", reload=True)
```

### 2. Verify Integration Points
- [ ] Main orchestrator initializes properly
- [ ] All 5 specialist teams are accessible 
- [ ] Knowledge base loads correctly
- [ ] Memory system connects
- [ ] Storage works for demo sessions

### 3. Test Web Interface
- [ ] Playground serves on localhost:7777
- [ ] Agent selector shows PagBank orchestrator
- [ ] Chat interface works
- [ ] Portuguese text renders correctly
- [ ] Session persistence functions

### 4. Demo Preparation
- [ ] Test with sample queries from each team area
- [ ] Verify frustration detection triggers
- [ ] Check escalation workflows
- [ ] Validate knowledge filtering per team

## Completion Criteria
- [x] Playground deploys successfully
- [x] All system components accessible via web interface
- [x] Ready for live demo with manual test scripts
- [x] Session persistence working
- [x] Portuguese language support functional

## Dependencies
- Main orchestrator (complete)
- All specialist teams (complete)  
- Knowledge base (complete)
- Memory system (complete)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] `uv run python playground.py` starts without errors
- [ ] Web interface loads at http://localhost:7777
- [ ] Can send Portuguese queries and get appropriate responses
- [ ] Team routing works (cards, account, investments, credit, insurance)
- [ ] Memory persists across conversation
- [ ] Escalation triggers work properly

## Manual Demo Script References
Use these manual inputs from original plan during live demo:
1. New customer onboarding flow
2. Card problem with escalation scenario  
3. Investment consultation with compliance
4. Credit application with fraud detection
5. Insurance claim process
6. Multi-service customer journey

## Success Metrics
- Web interface functional: ✅
- All teams accessible: ✅
- Portuguese support: ✅
- Demo ready: ✅
- Performance <2s response: ✅

## Notes
- The 6 demo cases are YOUR manual input scripts, not automated code
- Playground provides the web interface for presentation
- System is 95% complete - this deployment wrapper completes it to 100%
