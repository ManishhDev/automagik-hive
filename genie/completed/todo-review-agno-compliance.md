# Task: Review Agno Framework Compliance

## Objective
Validate all PagBank Multi-Agent System code against Agno framework best practices using official documentation tools.

## Instructions
1. Use `mcp__ask-repo-agent__ask_question` with repo `agno-agi/agno` to understand:
   - Proper Team coordination mode usage
   - Memory v2 integration patterns
   - Agent configuration best practices
   - Knowledge base integration patterns

2. Use `mcp__search-repo-docs__get-library-docs` with `context7/agno` to find:
   - Code examples for Team modes (coordinate vs route)
   - Memory system implementation patterns
   - Agent initialization best practices
   - Knowledge base filter usage

3. Review these specific files against Agno patterns:
   - `orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py` - Team route mode usage
   - `teams/base_team.py` - Team coordinate mode usage
   - `memory/memory_manager.py` - Memory v2 integration
   - `knowledge/csv_knowledge_base.py` - CSVKnowledgeBase usage
   - All team implementations in `teams/` directory

4. Create compliance report identifying:
   - Code that matches Agno patterns correctly
   - Code that deviates from best practices
   - Missing configurations or features
   - Recommended improvements

## Completion Criteria
- All major components validated against Agno documentation
- Compliance report with specific recommendations
- List of code changes needed for full Agno compliance
- Documentation of any intentional deviations

## Dependencies
- Access to `agno-agi/agno` repository via ask-repo-agent
- Access to `context7/agno` via search-repo-docs
- All Phase 1-4 code completed
