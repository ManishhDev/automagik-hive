# Task: Validate Knowledge Base Implementation

## Objective
Ensure knowledge base implementation follows Agno CSVKnowledgeBase patterns and optimizes search performance with proper filtering.

## Instructions
1. **Review Agno CSVKnowledgeBase documentation** using `mcp__ask-repo-agent__ask_question`:
   - Query: "How should CSVKnowledgeBase be configured with PgVector?"
   - Query: "What are best practices for knowledge base filtering?"
   - Query: "How to optimize search performance with embeddings?"

2. **Validate knowledge base implementation** in:
   - `knowledge/csv_knowledge_base.py` - Core CSV knowledge base
   - `knowledge/pagbank_knowledge.csv` - Data structure and content
   - Integration usage in all team files

3. **Check search implementation**:
   - PgVector integration correctness
   - Embedding model usage (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
   - Search filtering mechanisms
   - Performance optimization patterns

4. **Validate filtering systems**:
   - Team-specific knowledge filters
   - search_with_filters implementation
   - Filter combinations and logic
   - Results ranking and relevance

5. **Review knowledge data quality**:
   - CSV structure and completeness
   - Data consistency across entries
   - Portuguese language content quality
   - Missing or outdated information

6. **Test search performance**:
   - Query response times
   - Relevance of search results
   - Filter effectiveness
   - Memory usage during searches

7. **Integration validation**:
   - Knowledge base usage in teams
   - Context enhancement patterns
   - Reference extraction methods
   - Error handling for failed searches

## Completion Criteria
- CSVKnowledgeBase implementation validated against Agno specs
- Search performance optimizations identified
- Knowledge data quality assessed
- Filter system effectiveness verified
- Integration patterns confirmed correct

## Dependencies
- Access to Agno CSVKnowledgeBase documentation
- Knowledge base files completed
- Understanding of PgVector integration
