# Task: Validate Memory System Integration

## Objective
Ensure memory system integration follows Agno Memory v2 specifications and best practices for optimal performance.

## Instructions
1. **Review Memory v2 documentation** using `mcp__ask-repo-agent__ask_question`:
   - Query: "How should Memory v2 be configured with enable_agentic_memory?"
   - Query: "What are the best practices for SqliteMemoryDb setup?"
   - Query: "How should teams share memory contexts?"

2. **Validate current memory implementation** in:
   - `memory/memory_manager.py` - Core memory management
   - `memory/memory_config.py` - Configuration patterns
   - `memory/session_manager.py` - Session handling
   - `orchestrator/main_orchestrator.py` - Memory usage in orchestrator
   - `teams/base_team.py` - Team memory integration

3. **Check specific memory patterns**:
   - SqliteMemoryDb configuration correctness
   - enable_agentic_memory usage across teams
   - Memory sharing between agents
   - Session state persistence
   - Pattern detection implementation

4. **Validate memory usage in teams**:
   - Each team's memory attachment
   - Context sharing mechanisms
   - User pattern detection
   - Memory cleanup procedures

5. **Performance considerations**:
   - Memory database path configuration
   - Connection pooling if needed
   - Memory cleanup strategies
   - Pattern learning efficiency

6. **Integration testing**:
   - Memory persistence across sessions
   - Cross-team memory sharing
   - Pattern detection accuracy
   - Memory retrieval performance

## Completion Criteria
- Memory v2 implementation validated against Agno specs
- All memory configurations verified as correct
- Performance optimization recommendations
- List of memory-related issues to fix
- Documentation of memory usage patterns

## Dependencies
- Access to Agno Memory v2 documentation
- All memory-related code files completed
- Understanding of Agno best practices
