# Document Count Analysis - Resolution

## Summary
The discrepancy between expected (39) and actual (64) documents has been resolved.

## Findings

### Expected vs Actual
- **Plan expected**: 39 documents (10 + 15 + 14)
- **Actually found**: 67 total documents
- **Valid documents**: 64 documents
- **Generated in CSV**: 64 documents ✅

### Breakdown by File

#### antecipacao.md
- Total documents: 11
- Valid documents: 11
- Invalid documents: 0

#### cartoes.md  
- Total documents: 16
- Valid documents: 13
- Invalid documents: 3 (missing required sections)

#### conta.md
- Total documents: 40
- Valid documents: 40  
- Invalid documents: 0

### Why 3 Documents Were Skipped
The validation script correctly identified that 3 documents in cartoes.md are missing all required sections:
- Document 4: Missing all 3 sections
- Document 5: Missing all 3 sections
- Document 6: Missing all 3 sections

These were properly excluded from the CSV generation.

## Conclusions

1. **The implementation is CORRECT** - 64 valid documents were properly extracted and added to the CSV
2. **The plan's estimate was wrong** - It expected 39 but there are actually 64 valid documents
3. **Data quality is good** - Only 3 out of 67 documents (4.5%) had structural issues
4. **The validation worked** - Invalid documents were correctly identified and excluded

## Business Unit Distribution (Confirmed)
- PagBank: 40 documents (62.5%)
- Emissão: 13 documents (20.3%)
- Adquirência Web: 9 documents (14.1%)
- Adquirência Web / Adquirência Presencial: 2 documents (3.1%)

## Next Steps
Proceed with Step 4 testing plan knowing that:
- We have 64 valid documents to test
- 3 documents in cartoes.md need fixing if we want 100% coverage
- The current implementation correctly handles the available valid data
