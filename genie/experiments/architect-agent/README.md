# ArchitectAgent Experiment

## Overview

This experiment explores the implementation of a meta-agent capable of proposing new system components (agents, teams, workflows) for the Automagik Hive ecosystem.

## Key Concepts

### Constitutional Constraints
The ArchitectAgent operates under strict limits to prevent runaway expansion:
- Maximum 50 agents total
- Maximum hierarchy depth of 3
- No file system write access for generated agents
- All proposals require human approval

### HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) Workflow
1. Agent analyzes request
2. Generates YAML configuration
3. Validates against constraints
4. Proposes to human operator
5. Human reviews and approves/rejects
6. If approved, configuration is applied via hot-reload

## Implementation Details

### Component Generation
- **Agents**: Single-purpose specialists with defined capabilities
- **Teams**: Multi-agent groups in "route" or "coordinate" mode
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step processes combining multiple agents

### Safety Mechanisms
- Timestamp-based versioning prevents conflicts
- Validation ensures YAML syntax and uniqueness
- Constitutional constraints prevent dangerous capabilities
- Integration analysis prevents system conflicts

## Usage Example

```python
architect = ArchitectAgent(constitutional_limits)
proposal = architect.propose_agent("Create a code complexity analyzer")

if proposal.validation_status["security_compliant"]:
    # Present to human for approval
    apply_with_approval(proposal)
```

## Findings

1. **Technical Feasibility**: ‚úÖ Core mechanism works well
2. **Safety Concerns**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires robust validation layer
3. **Integration Complexity**: üîÑ Need careful dependency management
4. **Scalability**: üìà Can grow within defined limits

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with actual Automagik Hive registries
2. Build approval UI for configuration review
3. Implement rollback mechanism
4. Add monitoring for generated components
5. Create test suite for edge cases

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Template-based generation with human approval
- **Medium Risk**: Automated validation could miss edge cases  
- **High Risk**: Full autonomy without oversight (not implemented)

This experiment demonstrates that controlled self-expansion is feasible with proper safeguards.
