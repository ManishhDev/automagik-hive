# Test Fix Report: test_config_migration_final_coverage.py

## Issue Summary

The test file `tests/lib/utils/test_config_migration_final_coverage.py` had one failing test: `test_line_112_via_migrate_team_method`

## Root Cause

The failing test was caused by incorrect team configuration structure in the test setup. The test was expecting `result["agents_processed"]` to be 1, but it was actually 0.

After analyzing the source code in `lib/utils/config_migration.py`, I discovered that:

1. The `migrate_team` method expects the team configuration to have a "members" list at the root level
2. The test was incorrectly placing the members list inside the "team" object: `"team": {"members": ["line112-agent"]}`
3. This caused the method to not find any members to process, resulting in `agents_processed` being 0

## Solution

Fixed the team configuration structure in the failing test:

**Before:**
```python
team_config = {
    "team": {"name": "line112-team", "members": ["line112-agent"]},
    "memory": {"enable_user_memories": True, "num_history_runs": 10},
    "display": {"markdown": False, "show_tool_calls": True},
}
```

**After:**
```python
team_config = {
    "team": {"name": "line112-team"},
    "members": ["line112-agent"],  # Moved to root level
    "memory": {"enable_user_memories": True, "num_history_runs": 10},
    "display": {"markdown": False, "show_tool_calls": True},
}
```

## Test Results

All tests in the file now pass:

- ✅ `test_line_112_direct_execution_coverage` - PASSED
- ✅ `test_lines_226_227_comment_injection_coverage` - PASSED  
- ✅ `test_line_112_direct_method_coverage` - PASSED
- ✅ `test_line_112_via_migrate_team_method` - PASSED (previously failing)

## Coverage Target

This test file was specifically designed to achieve 100% coverage for `lib/utils/config_migration.py` by targeting:
- Line 112: `_apply_migration_to_agent` call in execute mode
- Lines 226-227: Comment injection when both param and category appear in same line

All coverage targets are now successfully tested with the fix applied.

## Files Modified

- `tests/lib/utils/test_config_migration_final_coverage.py` - Fixed team config structure in line 264

## Verification

The fix was validated by:
1. Running the specific failing test - now passes
2. Running all tests in the file - all 4 tests pass
3. Running broader utils test suite - no regressions introduced
