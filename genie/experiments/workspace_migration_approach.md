# Workspace Test Migration Analysis

## Migration Strategy

Instead of creating a script in the source directory, I'll manually migrate the remaining files following the pattern:

### Pattern for Migration:

**BEFORE:**
```python
def test_something(self):
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        workspace = Path(temp_dir)
        # ... test code ...

# OR with fixture:
@pytest.fixture
def temp_workspace(self):
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        yield Path(temp_dir)

def test_something(self, temp_workspace):
    # ... test code ...
```

**AFTER:**
```python
def test_something(self, isolated_workspace):
    workspace = isolated_workspace
    # ... test code ...
```

## Files Requiring Migration:

1. ✅ tests/integration/cli/test_workspace_commands.py (partially complete)
2. ⏳ tests/cli/commands/test_service.py 
3. ⏳ tests/integration/docker/test_compose_service.py
4. ⏳ tests/integration/cli/test_postgres_integration.py
5. ⏳ tests/integration/cli/test_cli_integration.py

## Migration Progress

Currently working on manual migration of each file to ensure proper isolated workspace usage.
