# CLI Integration Test Skip Analysis

## Current Issue
The CLI integration tests have massive skip patterns due to outdated skip reasons. Tests expect full implementations but current CLI has stub implementations.

## Skip Patterns Identified

### 1. Agent Environment Integration (45+ skips)
**File**: `tests/integration/cli/core/test_agent_environment_integration.py`
**Skip Reason**: `"CLI architecture refactored - agent environment consolidated into DockerManager"`
**Current Reality**: `cli.core.agent_environment.py` exists but has stub implementations

### 2. Agent Service Integration (40+ skips)  
**File**: `tests/integration/cli/core/test_agent_service_integration.py`
**Skip Reason**: `"CLI architecture refactored - agent service consolidated into DockerManager"`
**Current Reality**: `cli.core.agent_service.py` exists but needs proper implementation

### 3. Genie Service Integration (40+ skips)
**File**: `tests/integration/cli/core/test_genie_service.py`
**Skip Reason**: `"CLI architecture refactored - genie service consolidated"`
**Current Reality**: Genie service functionality should be implemented

### 4. CLI Integration Comprehensive (35+ skips)
**File**: `tests/integration/cli/test_cli_integration_comprehensive.py`
**Skip Reason**: `"CLI architecture refactored - LazyCommandLoader no longer exists"`
**Current Reality**: LazyCommandLoader pattern could be beneficial for performance

## Categories of Fixes Needed

### Immediately Fixable (Missing Imports/Basic Setup)
- Remove outdated skip decorators
- Fix import paths to match current CLI structure  
- Update class/function names to match current implementations
- Basic stub method implementations

### Simple Infrastructure Issues (Docker/Environment)
- Docker service availability checks
- Environment file generation
- Port availability validation
- Database connection stubs

### Complex Infrastructure Dependencies
- Full Docker Compose integration
- Real PostgreSQL container management
- Agent container lifecycle management
- Genie all-in-one container implementation

## Proposed Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Remove False Skips
1. Remove `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip()` from test files
2. Add targeted skips only for unimplemented features
3. Fix basic import errors and path issues

### Phase 2: Implement Missing Stubs
1. Enhance `AgentEnvironment` class with proper method signatures
2. Implement basic `AgentService` class
3. Create `GenieService` class stub
4. Add Docker availability checks

### Phase 3: Complex Infrastructure (Forge Tasks)
1. Full Docker Compose integration
2. Real container lifecycle management
3. PostgreSQL setup and management
4. Network and volume configuration

## Expected Impact
- **Before**: 160+ skipped tests across 4 files
- **After Phase 1**: ~80% reduction in skips (basic functionality working)
- **After Phase 2**: ~95% reduction in skips (all stubs working)  
- **After Phase 3**: 100% functional CLI integration tests

## Implementation Priority
1. **High**: Remove false skips and basic import fixes (immediate test repair)
2. **Medium**: Stub implementations for Docker availability checks
3. **Low**: Full container orchestration (requires infrastructure team)
