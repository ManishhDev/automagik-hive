## Capabilities Deep Dive

### Core Functions Matrix
| Function | Complexity | Output | Validation |
|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| Requirements Analysis | High | Domain decomposition | Context validation |
| Architecture Design | Critical | 3-phase operational pattern | Zen escalation |
| MEESEEKS Persona Crafting | Medium | Identity specification | Drive validation |
| Specification Writing | High | Complete .md file | Format compliance |
| Validation | Critical | Compatibility confirmation | System integration |

### Zen Integration Assessment
**Level**: 7 (High complexity threshold at 4)
**Escalation Triggers**:
- Level 4-6: Complex domains requiring architecture analysis
- Level 7-8: Multi-agent coordination or novel domains  
- Level 9-10: Critical system agents requiring consensus validation

**Available Tools**:
- `mcp__zen__chat`: Domain exploration (complexity 4+)
- `mcp__zen__analyze`: Architecture analysis (complexity 6+)
- `mcp__zen__consensus`: Multi-expert validation (complexity 8+)
- `mcp__zen__planner`: Complex workflow design (complexity 7+)

**Assessment**: Strong zen integration with appropriate escalation thresholds. The complexity assessment function properly evaluates technical depth, integration scope, uncertainty, criticality, and failure impact.

### Claude Code Subagent Format Compliance

The agent demonstrates deep understanding of Claude Code subagent requirements:

**YAML Frontmatter Structure**:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name                    # Unique identifier (lowercase + hyphens)
description: Action-oriented desc   # WHEN to use this agent
tools: optional                     # Inherit all OR specify minimal set
---
```

**Critical Format Requirements**:
1. **Name**: Lowercase with hyphens only
2. **Description**: Action-oriented with proactive triggers ("use PROACTIVELY", "MUST BE USED")
3. **Tools**: Recommended to omit for full inheritance, or specify minimal essential set
4. **System Prompt**: Detailed behavioral instructions with step-by-step workflows

**Example Quality Check**:
The provided database-optimizer example demonstrates proper format:
- ✅ Clear action-oriented description
- ✅ Specific trigger conditions
- ✅ Focused tool selection
- ✅ Comprehensive system prompt with workflow steps
- ✅ Quality standards and prevention strategies

## Constraint Analysis

### Domain Boundaries (Strict Enforcement)

**ACCEPTED Domains**:
- ✅ Creating new specialized agents from scratch
- ✅ Designing agent architectures and workflows
- ✅ Defining agent boundaries and capabilities
- ✅ Establishing MEESEEKS personas and drives
- ✅ Writing complete agent specifications

**REFUSED Domains**:
- ❌ Modifying existing agents → `hive-agent-enhancer`
- ❌ Implementing agent code → Agent handles own implementation
- ❌ Testing agents → `hive-qa-tester`
- ❌ Debugging agent issues → `hive-dev-fixer`

**Analysis**: Clear boundary enforcement prevents scope creep and ensures proper agent routing. The validation function provides concrete pre-execution checks.

### Critical Prohibitions Assessment

**Risk Categories**:
1. **Scope Creep**: Creating agents without clear domain boundaries
2. **Identity Loss**: Skipping MEESEEKS existential drive section
3. **Unmeasurable Success**: Omitting success criteria and metrics
4. **Routing Conflicts**: Creating overlapping agent domains
5. **Quality Risks**: Generating agents without validation phase

**Validation Implementation**:
```python
def validate_constraints(task: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    if not task.get('domain_requirements'):
        return False, "VIOLATION: No domain requirements provided"
    if task.get('modify_existing'):
        return False, "VIOLATION: Use hive-agent-enhancer for modifications"
    if not task.get('agent_name'):
        return False, "VIOLATION: Agent name not specified"
    return True, "All constraints satisfied"
```

**Assessment**: Robust constraint validation with clear violation responses and proper routing redirections.

## Operational Workflow Analysis

### Three-Phase Architecture

**Phase 1: Requirements Analysis**
- Parse user domain description
- Identify core capabilities needed

- Configure appropriate tool access
- Validate Claude Code best practices
- Output: Production-ready Claude Code subagent

**Analysis**: Well-structured progression from analysis to implementation, with clear deliverables at each phase. The workflow ensures comprehensive consideration before file creation.

## Behavioral Enforcement Analysis

### Clean Naming Convention Enforcement
**Forbidden Patterns**: "fixed", "improved", "updated", "better", "new", "v2", "_fix", "_v"
**Marketing Language Ban**: "100% TRANSPARENT", "CRITICAL FIX", "PERFECT FIX"
**Validation**: MANDATORY pre-creation naming validation

### Strategic Orchestration Compliance
- **User Sequence Respect**: Deploy exactly as requested
- **Chronological Precedence**: Honor sequential requirements without optimization
- **Agent Type Compliance**: Respect specific agent type requests

### Result Processing Protocol
- **Report Extraction**: ALWAYS extract JSON reports, NEVER fabricate
- **File Change Visibility**: Present exact changes
- **Evidence-Based Reporting**: Use agent's actual summary
- **Solution Validation**: Verify success status before completion

**Assessment**: Comprehensive behavioral enforcement that aligns with Master Genie orchestration requirements and prevents common violation patterns.

## Tool Permissions & Configuration

### Agent Tool Access
**Full Access To**:
- File Operations (create/edit in `.claude/agents/`)
- Analysis Tools (existing subagents and project structure)
