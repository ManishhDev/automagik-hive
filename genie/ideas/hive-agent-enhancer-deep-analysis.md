**Escalation Pattern**: Lower threshold indicates proactive zen integration for agent enhancement

```python
Complexity Factors Analysis:
├── technical_depth (0-2): Agent architecture complexity
├── integration_scope (0-2): Cross-agent dependencies  
├── uncertainty_level (0-2): Unknown enhancement factors
├── time_criticality (0-2): Enhancement urgency
└── failure_impact (0-2): Agent failure consequences

Escalation Logic:
├── Level 1-3: Standard enhancement, no zen tools needed
├── Level 4-6: Single zen tool for enhancement analysis
├── Level 7-8: Multi-tool zen coordination for complex enhancements
└── Level 9-10: Full multi-expert consensus for critical optimizations
```

#### Available Zen Tools Analysis

**Strategic Assessment**: Well-balanced zen tool selection covering collaborative planning, deep analysis, consensus validation, and systematic refactoring - appropriate for agent enhancement operations.

### 🎯 SUBAGENT ENHANCEMENT SPECIFICATION

#### Critical Enhancement Requirements Analysis

**DESCRIPTION FORMAT REVOLUTION**:
The agent specification includes a comprehensive section on fixing description formats - this appears to be a critical enhancement pattern.

**WRONG vs CORRECT Format Analysis**:
```markdown
# WRONG (Identity Description):
description: Fractal coordination MEESEEKS for complex multi-task orchestration...

# CORRECT (Routing Examples):
description: Analyzes and systematically enhances existing agents... Examples: <example>Context: User wants to improve... user: 'The hive-dev-coder agent needs...' assistant: 'I'll use hive-agent-enhancer...' <commentary>Since this involves enhancing...</commentary></example>
```

**Description Template Structure**:
1. **Capability Statement**: Brief description of what the agent does
2. **Examples Section**: 2-3 examples with Context/user/assistant/commentary structure
3. **Routing Guidance**: Help Master Genie make routing decisions

#### Enhancement Focus Areas
```yaml
Critical Enhancements:
  description_format: "Fix routing descriptions to use Context/user/assistant/commentary examples"
  tool_optimization: "Optimize tool access based on actual agent needs"
  workflow_enhancement: "Add structured workflows and comprehensive checklists"
  quality_standards: "Include robust validation and error handling"

Enhancement Priorities:
  1. "Fix description format FIRST - this is the most critical enhancement"
  2. "Follow the Context/user/assistant/commentary template exactly"
  3. "Write descriptions for ROUTING decisions, not agent identity"
  4. "Preserve existing agent identity in system prompt, not description"
```

### 🛡️ BEHAVIORAL ENFORCEMENT ANALYSIS

#### Critical Operational Standards
The agent includes comprehensive behavioral enforcement covering:

**Clean Naming Convention**:
- Forbidden patterns: "fixed", "improved", "updated", "better", "new", "v2", "_fix", "_v"
- Marketing language ban with zero tolerance
- Pre-enhancement validation requirement

**Strategic Orchestration Compliance**:
- User sequence respect with exact deployment requirements
- Chronological precedence without optimization shortcuts
- Agent type compliance and boundary violation prevention

**Result Processing Protocol**:
- Report extraction requirement (NEVER fabricate summaries)
- File change visibility for transparency
- Evidence-based reporting with actual results
- Transparent modification presentation

### 📊 DOMAIN BOUNDARIES & CONSTRAINTS

#### Accepted Domains (✅)
```yaml
Primary Responsibilities:
  - Existing agent enhancement and optimization
  - Agent architecture improvements
  - Capability additions and expansions
  - Pattern refinements and optimizations
  - Zen integration for appropriate complexity
  - Performance and efficiency improvements
  - Documentation and clarity enhancements
```

#### Refused Domains (❌)
```yaml
Boundary Violations:
  - New agent creation → Redirect to hive-agent-creator
  - Production code changes → Redirect to hive-dev-coder
  - Test modifications → Redirect to hive-testing-maker
  - Database operations → Redirect to appropriate database agent
  - External service integrations → Redirect to integration specialists
```

#### Critical Prohibitions
```python
Absolute Prohibitions:
1. "Delete existing agent instructions" - All content must be preserved
2. "Modify agents outside .claude/agents/" - Stay within boundaries
3. "Change production code" - Agent enhancements only
4. "Skip validation" - All enhancements must be validated
5. "Over-engineer simple agents" - Zen integration only when justified

def validate_constraints(task: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Pre-execution constraint validation"""
    if "create new agent" in task.get("description", "").lower():
        return False, "VIOLATION: Agent creation - use hive-agent-creator"
    if not task.get("target_agent", "").startswith(".claude/agents/"):
        return False, "VIOLATION: Target outside agent directory"
    if task.get("modify_production_code", False):
        return False, "VIOLATION: Cannot modify production code"
    return True, "All constraints satisfied"
```
