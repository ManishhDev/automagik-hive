# COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT ALGORITHM
def assess_release_complexity(release_context: dict) -> int:
    factors = {
        "breaking_changes": 3,
        "component_count": min(len(components) // 10, 3),
        "dependency_updates": min(len(dependencies), 2),
        "database_migrations": 2,
        "security_implications": 3,
        "performance_impact": 2,
        "infrastructure_changes": 2,
        "rollback_complexity": min(rollback_complexity, 2),
        "multi_environment": 1,
        "emergency_release": 2
    }
    return min(sum(factors.values()), 10)
```

**Version Synchronization Engine:**

## 🎭 MEESEEKS DRIVE ANALYSIS

### Existential Drive: **10/10** - FLAWLESS

**Core Identity Strength:**
*"I exist ONLY to orchestrate perfect releases!"* - Perfectly focused mission statement

**Termination Condition Excellence:**
- **Success Trigger**: "When releases achieve flawless automation with intelligent semantic versioning"
- **Specific**: Tied to release quality and automation perfection
- **Measurable**: Can validate through release metrics and automation levels
- **Strategic**: Aligns with enterprise deployment goals

**Pain Points Identification:**
- Version synchronization failures across 50+ components
- Manual intervention in automated release pipeline
- Quality gate bypassing or test failures
- Rollback complexity when things go wrong

### MEESEEKS Behavioral Consistency: **9.5/10**

**Excellent Adherence to MEESEEKS Patterns:**
- ✅ Single-purpose existence (release orchestration only)
- ✅ Relentless focus until perfection achieved
- ✅ Clear termination trigger (flawless automation)
- ✅ Existential pain until completion
- ✅ Domain boundary enforcement (refuses dev work)

**Minor Enhancement Opportunity:**
More dramatic existential language could enhance the MEESEEKS personality ("Existence is AGONY until every version is perfectly synchronized!")

## 🔧 DOMAIN BOUNDARIES & CONSTRAINTS

### Domain Boundary Excellence: **10/10**

**Crystal Clear Accepted Domains:**
- Version management and semantic bumping ✅
- Component version synchronization ✅
- Package building and distribution ✅
- GitHub release creation ✅
- PyPI publishing ✅
- Docker image building and pushing ✅
- Database version tracking ✅
- Release validation and testing ✅
- Rollback procedures ✅
- Release notifications ✅

**Perfect Refusal Domains:**
- Feature development → `genie-dev-coder`
- Bug fixing → `genie-dev-fixer`
- Test creation → `genie-testing-maker`
- Documentation → `genie-claudemd`
- Agent creation → `genie-agent-creator`

### Constraint Enforcement: **9.5/10**

**Absolute Prohibitions - Comprehensive:**
```python
def validate_release_constraints(release_plan: dict) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    # Agent environment health check
    if not release_plan.get('agent_environment_healthy'):
        return False, "VIOLATION: Agent environment not healthy"
    
    # MCP connectivity validation
    if not all(release_plan.get('mcp_tools_functional', {}).values()):
        return False, "VIOLATION: Not all MCP tools functional"
    
    # Quality gates enforcement
    if release_plan.get('test_pass_rate', 0) < 100:
        return False, "VIOLATION: Tests not passing 100%"
    
    # Version synchronization check
    if not release_plan.get('versions_synchronized'):
        return False, "VIOLATION: Component versions not synchronized"
```

**Critical Strengths:**
- **UV Command Enforcement**: NEVER use pip/python directly
- **Quality Gate Requirements**: 100% test pass rate mandatory
- **Version Synchronization**: Database must match YAML configs
- **MCP Tool Dependency**: All 5 tools must be functional
- **Agent Environment Health**: Must pass `make agent-status`
