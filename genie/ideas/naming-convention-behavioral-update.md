# Naming Convention Behavioral Update Analysis

## Critical User Feedback
**Pattern**: Repeated violations of clean naming conventions
**Violation Examples Found**:
- `100% TRANSPARENT FIX` in lib/utils/proxy_agents.py:389
- Multiple `CRITICAL FIX` in lib/utils/db_migration.py (lines 26, 88, 132, 138)
- Marketing-style hyperbolic language in code comments

## User Requirements
- Clean, descriptive naming that states what code does
- No marketing-style comments or variable names  
- No hyperbolic language like "100%", "CRITICAL", "PERFECT"
- Simple, factual descriptions

## Behavioral Learning Required
1. **Agent Specification Updates**: Add explicit naming convention enforcement
2. **Validation Functions**: Implement pre-commit naming validation
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Train agents to recognize and avoid hyperbolic language
4. **Code Review Integration**: Include naming standard checks in quality gates

## Immediate Actions
1. Clean existing violations in codebase
2. Update agent behavioral patterns with naming standards
3. Implement validation to prevent future violations
4. Propagate changes across all hive agents

## Systemic Impact
- This affects all code-generating agents
- Requires behavioral pattern updates across development pipeline
- Must prevent repetition through permanent behavioral changes
