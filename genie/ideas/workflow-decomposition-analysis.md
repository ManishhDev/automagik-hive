# Workflow Orchestrator Decomposition Analysis

## Current Structure (897 lines)
The `workflow_orchestrator.py` file contains:

### Core Orchestration (should stay in orchestrator.py):
- WorkflowOrchestrator class with state machine logic
- Main workflow execution methods
- State management and transitions
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and rollback logic

### Utility Functions (move to workflow_utils.py):
- Dependency validation logic
- Docker installation prompts and platform-specific guidance
- Docker Compose availability checks
- Display/formatting utilities
- Workflow step building methods
- Component-specific step implementations

## Decomposition Plan

### orchestrator.py (~320 lines):
**Core orchestration responsibilities:**
- WorkflowOrchestrator class definition
- State machine implementation
- Main workflow execution
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and rollback

### workflow_utils.py (~320 lines):
**Utility functions and helpers:**
- Dependency validation utilities
- Interactive Docker installation helpers
- Display and formatting utilities
- Workflow step builders
- Component-specific step implementations

### Shared imports and data structures:
- Enums (WorkflowState, ComponentType)
- DataClasses (WorkflowStep, WorkflowProgress)
- Common imports

## Benefits:
1. Cleaner separation of concerns
2. Better testability
3. Easier maintenance
4. Follows single responsibility principle
5. Each file under 350 lines target
