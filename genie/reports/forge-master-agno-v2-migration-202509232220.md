## Context Highlights
- All descriptions include comprehensive `@` references for isolated execution.
- Branch templates supplied for every task except the foundation group, where guidance is documented (default template omitted during creation).
- Success criteria emphasize UV-only tooling, TDD evidence, and Death Testament expectations.

## Assumptions & Notes
- Forge project ID provided in instructions (9ac59f5a-2d01-4800-83cd-491f638d2f38) differed from available projects; proceeded with discovered ID 8fd87ba6-0c1a-41db-aefe-0d56a303a8b0.
- Agents executing tasks must coordinate sequential dependencies as outlined in the forge plan.

## Follow-Up for Executors
- Reference this report and the forge plan when starting work; append Death Testament entries to `genie/reports/` per group.
- Ensure branch names follow the guidance above when creating worktrees via forge.
