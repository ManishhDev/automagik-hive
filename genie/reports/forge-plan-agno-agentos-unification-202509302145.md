# Forge Planning Report — Agno AgentOS Unification

**Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-09-30 21:45
**Wish:** @genie/wishes/agno-agentos-unification-wish.md (Status: DRAFT)

## Discovery Notes
- Goal: consolidate Agno playground endpoints, AgentOS config, and wish telemetry inside Hive's FastAPI deployment while keeping UV/tooling guardrails.
- Key constraints: maintain auth enforcement, avoid touching `pyproject.toml`, document migration away from standalone compose routes.
- Risk areas: ensuring embedded playground availability toggles do not regress existing startup flow; coordinating docs/tests across multiple surfaces; wish status must be advanced to APPROVED before forge execution.

## Proposed Task Groups

### Group 1 — foundation-settings (Agent: hive-coder)
- **Scope:** Implement configuration toggles for embedded playground + Control Pane URLs, extend startup orchestration displays, refresh compose README guidance.
- **Dependencies:** None.
- **Expected Evidence:** Death Testament detailing settings changes + startup output; diff excerpts for `lib/config/settings.py`, `lib/utils/startup_orchestration.py`; doc snippet for `agent-infra-docker/README.md`.

### Group 2 — runtime-unification (Agent: hive-coder)
- **Scope:** Update `api/serve.py` and `api/main.py` to mount playground/wish routers under unified auth, add dedicated wish telemetry route module.
- **Dependencies:** Group 1 (requires new settings toggles).
- **Expected Evidence:** Death Testament with route list, FastAPI logs, code references for new router; minimal smoke validation via `uv run uvicorn`.

### Group 3 — agentos-alignment (Agent: hive-coder)
- **Scope:** Enrich AgentOS service + config models with playground/wish metadata, harden dependency provider, capture Control Pane setup guidance in README.
- **Dependencies:** Group 1 for settings, Group 2 for route availability.
- **Expected Evidence:** Death Testament citing updated `/api/v1/agentos/config` payload, curl output, README excerpt.

### Group 4 — integration-cli-mcp (Agent: hive-coder)
- **Scope:** Add CLI wish catalog command, register unified endpoints in MCP catalog, create ops verification script.
- **Dependencies:** Groups 2 & 3 (needs API endpoints + AgentOS data).
- **Expected Evidence:** Death Testament with CLI command demo, MCP registry diff, script execution log.

### Group 5 — tests-and-doc-validation (Agent: hive-tests)
- **Scope:** Author API/CLI/integration pytest coverage and run doc lint/validation steps.
- **Dependencies:** Groups 2–4 complete.
- **Expected Evidence:** Death Testament including pytest results, lint outputs, QA checklist verifying docs and scripts.

## Approvals
- **Pending:** Await human confirmation of groupings and acknowledgement that wish status will be elevated to APPROVED before task creation.


## Approvals
- 2025-09-30 21:47 UTC — Human approved proposed grouping and authorized forge task creation (recorded by GENIE).
