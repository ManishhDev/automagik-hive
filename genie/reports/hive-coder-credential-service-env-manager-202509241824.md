# Death Testament â€“ Env Manager Implementation (hive-coder)

## Scope & Outcomes
- Introduced `lib/auth/env_file_manager.py` to centralize `.env`/`.env.master` resolution, hydration, synchronization, and credential extraction.
- Refactored `lib/auth/credential_service.py` to compose the manager, streamline env I/O, refresh cached paths, and preserve backward-compatible API (including error propagation semantics and container metadata).
- Updated `docker/lib/postgres_manager.py` to rely on workspace-scoped `CredentialService` instances instead of cwd mutation, ensuring new manager integration.
- Restored explicit `CONTAINERS` metadata and alias-first behaviour expected by existing tests and integration flows.

## Verification Evidence
- `uv run pytest tests/lib/auth/test_credential_service.py -q`
  - Pass (54 passed, 2 skipped). Coverage warnings persist for unrelated utility modules. Pydantic deprecation warning unchanged.
- `uv run pytest tests/integration/auth/test_single_credential_integration.py -q`
  - Pass (3 passed). Same coverage + Pydantic warnings noted.
- `uv run automagik-hive install --help`
  - Pass. CLI help rendered; temporary API key log emitted by existing init hook.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Coverage tooling still emits parsing warnings for legacy utility modules; no changes here, but quality agents may want to silence or track separately.
- `EnvFileManager` currently hard-codes `.env.example` fallback identical to previous template; if future wishes demand configurable templates, consider parameterizing via dependency injection.
- Docker helper now instantiates workspace-scoped credential services on demand; if long-lived state is required across invocations, evaluate caching in future phases.

## Files Touched
- `lib/auth/env_file_manager.py`
- `lib/auth/credential_service.py`
- `docker/lib/postgres_manager.py`
