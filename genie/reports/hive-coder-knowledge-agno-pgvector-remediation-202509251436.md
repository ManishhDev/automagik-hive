# Death Testament — hive-coder — knowledge-agno-pgvector-remediation

## Scope
- Remediated static analysis blockers for the Agno knowledge/pgvector alignment wish per reviewer checklist.
- Added stub dependencies (`pandas-stubs`, `types-PyYAML`, `types-tqdm`) to unblock mypy.
- Hardened SQL usage and typing across knowledge factory, repository, loaders, and support utilities.

## Files Touched
- `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`
- `lib/knowledge/config_aware_filter.py`
- `lib/knowledge/csv_hot_reload.py`
- `lib/knowledge/datasources/csv_datasource.py`
- `lib/knowledge/factories/__init__.py`
- `lib/knowledge/factories/knowledge_factory.py`
- `lib/knowledge/filters/business_unit_filter.py`
- `lib/knowledge/repositories/knowledge_repository.py`
- `lib/knowledge/row_based_csv_knowledge.py`
- `lib/knowledge/services/change_analyzer.py`
- `lib/knowledge/services/hash_manager.py`
- `lib/knowledge/smart_incremental_loader.py`

## Validation Log
1. `uv run ruff check lib/knowledge`
   - **Before:** Failed with S608 (SQL), S324 (MD5), S110 (try/except/pass).
   - **After:** All checks passed.
2. `uv run mypy lib/knowledge`
   - **Before:** 58 errors (missing stubs, Optional misuse, Row[Any] indexing, create_engine typing).
   - **After:** Success: no issues found.
3. `uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge -q`
   - Result: 422 passed, 2 skipped. Existing coverage warnings about unparsable legacy helper modules persist.
4. `uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge -q`
   - Result: 180 passed. Same pre-existing coverage warnings; no regressions observed.

## Key Changes
- Replaced raw f-string SQL with identifier validation + documented `# noqa: S608` escapes where safe, and added try/None guards for `Row[Any]` access.
- Annotated public helpers and filters with explicit types, plus sanitized optional defaults to satisfy `no_implicit_optional`.
- Updated loaders to reuse sanitized engine helper, converted rollback `pass` blocks into debug logging, and preserved legacy MD5 semantics with localized S324 justifications.
- Strengthened `RowBasedCSVKnowledgeBase` bookkeeping: optional knowledge handling, signature guards for documents lacking IDs, callable inspection hygiene for async upserts.
- Added casts around configuration loaders to keep mypy happy while retaining runtime flexibility.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Coverage warnings stem from legacy dynamic modules outside this remediation scope; flag remains for broader cleanup.
- CSV hot reload still depends on watchdog presence at runtime; mypy-safe fallbacks introduced but runtime behaviour unchanged.
- Monitor downstream wishes for any remaining optional typing gaps in non-knowledge packages (not touched here).
