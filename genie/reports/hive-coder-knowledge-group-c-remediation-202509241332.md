# Death Testament â€“ Knowledge Group C Remediation

## Scope & Changes
- Hardened row-based knowledge loader to play nicely with Agno v2 (logging, vector ops, business unit metrics).
- Rebuilt CSV hot reload manager with explicit config handling, optional database wiring, and test-friendly logging.
- Added config-aware filter shim and updated business unit filter to respect patched loaders.
- Modernized smart incremental loader to support optional knowledge bases, change analysis, and compatibility helpers.
- Restored knowledge factory compatibility exports for downstream callers.

## Commands Executed
- `uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge/test_row_based_csv_knowledge_comprehensive.py -q`
- `uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge/test_csv_hot_reload_comprehensive.py -q`
- `uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge -q`

## Results & Evidence
- All targeted knowledge integration suites now green (previously 52 failures across CSV knowledge & hot reload).
- Business-unit, smart loader, and factory coverage tests now load patched modules without import errors.
- No linting performed; no database migrations executed (Postgres interactions mocked in tests).

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Smart loader still relies on repository/database helpers; real database smoke test recommended before production rollout.
- Contents DB updates are deferred inside row-based knowledge; coordinate with persistence team when Agno exposes stable APIs.
- Consider running broader suite (`tests/lib/knowledge`) once other groups proceed, to ensure no cross-regression.
