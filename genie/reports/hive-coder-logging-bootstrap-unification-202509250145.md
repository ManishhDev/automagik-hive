# Hive Coder Death Testament – logging-bootstrap-unification (2025-09-25T01:45Z)

## Scope & Outcomes
- Implemented unified logging bootstrap via `initialize_logging(surface=...)` that wraps `ensure_logging_initialized()` and logs once per process.
- Replaced direct `setup_logging()` invocation across API, CLI, Docker compose helper, and validator script with the new helper while keeping emoji batching intact.
- Cleared stdlib root handlers during setup to avoid duplicate emissions and documented the contract in `lib/logging/CLAUDE.md`.
- Updated pytest patches to target the new helper to maintain fixture safety.

## Files Touched
- api/main.py
- api/serve.py
- cli/commands/service.py
- cli/main.py
- docker/lib/compose_service.py
- lib/logging/config.py
- lib/logging/__init__.py
- lib/logging/CLAUDE.md
- scripts/validate_logging.py
- tests/api/test_serve.py
- tests/conftest.py

## Commands Executed
```bash
# Attempted targeted test run (blocked by sandbox DNS restrictions)
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run pytest tests/api/test_serve.py tests/cli/test_main.py
```
- Result: ❌ Failed. `uv` could not download `anthropic==0.64.0` because external network access is restricted (`Temporary failure in name resolution`).

## Evidence & Observations
- `lib/logging/config.py`: added `initialize_logging(surface, force=False)` returning whether initialization occurred, and clearing `logging.getLogger().handlers` before attaching the emoji-aware handler. The helper logs a debug breadcrumb once initialization succeeds.
- Entry surfaces (`api/serve.py`, `api/main.py`, CLI bootstrap, Docker compose helper, validator script) now call `initialize_logging(...)`. CLI service manager also initializes when instantiated to cover reuse outside the main script.
- `lib/logging/CLAUDE.md` now documents the bootstrap contract and example usage, ensuring governance reflects the shared helper.
- Pytest fixtures patch `lib.logging.initialize_logging` instead of `setup_logging`, aligning mocks with the new contract while keeping environment overrides intact.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Full pytest suite not executed due to restricted network; Group 3 should rerun `uv run pytest` once connectivity or cached artifacts are available.
- Consider pruning legacy `setup_logging` re-exports once downstream consumers migrate completely; noted for future cleanup.

## Validation Plan for QA (Group 3)
1. Ensure dependencies are available offline or via approved cache, then rerun `uv run pytest tests/api/test_serve.py tests/cli/test_main.py` to confirm entry point coverage.
2. Execute a CLI smoke command (e.g., `UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run automagik-hive --version`) to confirm logging bootstrap behaves under CLI usage.
3. Start `uv run uvicorn api.serve:app --factory` and verify INFO-level logs adhere to `HIVE_LOG_LEVEL` overrides.
