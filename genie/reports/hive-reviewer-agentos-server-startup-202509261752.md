# Hive Reviewer • AgentOS Wish Startup Regression

## Scope
- Investigated server startup failure after completing wish `genie/wishes/agentos-api-configuration-wish.md`.
- Focused on runtime import path for `api/serve.py` and cross-module dependencies introduced in Groups B–C.

## Validation
- `uv run python -c "import api.serve"`
  - ❌ Fails with `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_agent' … (partially initialized module 'lib.utils.version_factory')`.

## Findings
1. **Circular import introduced by new re-export**
   - Re-exporting `AgentOSService` inside `lib/services/__init__.py:7` forces `lib/services` to load the AgentOS service whenever any consumer imports `lib.services`. Runtime stack shows `lib.versioning.agno_version_service` → `lib.services.component_version_service` → `lib/services/__init__.py` → `lib/services/agentos_service.py`.
   - `AgentOSService` imports `ai.agents.registry.AgentRegistry` (`lib/services/agentos_service.py:17`), which immediately imports `lib.utils.version_factory.create_agent` (`ai/agents/registry.py:11`). During this import, `lib.utils.version_factory` is still initializing (it triggered this chain), so Python raises a circular import error.
2. **Wish success criteria conflict**
   - Wish requirement “Service surface exported as `AgentOSService` in `lib/services/agentos_service.py` and re-exported via `lib/services/__init__.py`” is satisfied, but the re-export is the mechanism causing the regression. No guard (lazy import/TYPE_CHECKING) was implemented to break the cycle.
3. **Server startup blocked**
   - Any command that imports `api.serve` (including `uv run automagik-hive --serve`/`--dev`) currently fails, preventing validation of the completed wish in an integrated environment.

## Verdict
HOLD – Cannot approve wish completion until the circular import is resolved and server startup succeeds.

## Follow-ups / Delegation
- Spawn `hive-coder` (or appropriate integration agent) to refactor the dependency chain. Options include:
  1. Stop re-exporting `AgentOSService` in `lib/services/__init__.py` and adjust call sites to import directly.
  2. Defer the `AgentRegistry` import inside `AgentOSService` methods (lazy import) to avoid module-level dependency.
  3. Introduce intermediary module (e.g., `lib.services.agentos_registry`) to decouple service instantiation from registry lookups.
- After fix, rerun `uv run python -c "import api.serve"` and full AgentOS test suite to confirm stability.

## Human Decisions Needed
- Select preferred remediation approach balancing wish requirement vs. runtime safety.
- Decide if success criteria should be updated to allow non-re-exported service or alternate pattern.
