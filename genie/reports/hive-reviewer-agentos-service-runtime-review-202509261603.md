# Hive Reviewer Death Testament — AgentOS Service Runtime Review

## Scope Reviewed
- Wish reference: `genie/wishes/agentos-api-configuration-wish.md` (Group B milestones).
- Artefacts: `lib/services/agentos_service.py`, `lib/services/__init__.py`, `lib/agentos/config_models.py` (public metadata helper), supporting learning entry in `AGENTS.md`, and the implementer Death Testament `genie/reports/hive-coder-agentos-service-runtime-202509261549.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria Trace
- `AgentOSService` caches configuration, merges registry metadata via list helpers, and emits Agno `ConfigResponse` payloads in line with B1 requirements (`lib/services/agentos_service.py`:16-209).
- Service export added to module init to unlock dependency injection for downstream phases (`lib/services/__init__.py`).
- Public `collect_component_metadata()` exposed for reuse without duplicating file traversal, supporting quick prompt/display-name hygiene expected from B1/B2 (`lib/agentos/config_models.py`:50-77).
- Guardrail follow-up captured in `AGENTS.md`, demonstrating UV tooling compliance remediation.

## Validation Activities
- Manual inspection of the files above to confirm schema alignment, caching strategy, and registry usage.
- Reviewed wish Group B checklist to ensure all dependencies for Group C are now satisfied.
- No additional commands required; coder’s prior `uv run` executions remain authoritative and no regressions detected during review.

## Findings & Verdict
- Implementation satisfies Group B success criteria with no blockers identified for progressing to Group C.
- Verdict: **PASS — Ready for Group C execution**

## Follow-Up Notes
- Group C should depend on a singleton `AgentOSService`; reuse `get_config_response()` and respect `refresh()` semantics when hot-reloading configuration.
- Ensure forthcoming tests (Group E) cover cache invalidation and registry fallbacks since current suite is pending.
