# Death Testament – Agno AgentOS Groups A–C Review

## Scope
- Validated Group A foundation settings and startup surface summaries.
- Audited Group B FastAPI surface unification plus newly added wish catalog router.
- Reviewed Group C AgentOS service alignment and documentation updates.
- Cross-referenced implementation against wish success criteria and prior Death Testaments.

## Evidence
- `uv run pytest tests/api/routes/test_wish_router.py -q`
  - ✅ Passed (authentication guard + catalog payload checks). Coverage emitted legacy parse warnings for `lib/utils/error_handlers.py` and `lib/utils/fallback_model.py` (pre-existing).
- `uv run pytest tests/api/routes/test_agentos_router.py -q`
  - ✅ Passed (AgentOS routes enforce auth and advertise wish/catalog interfaces). Same coverage warnings observed.
- `uv run pytest tests/api/test_agentos_config.py -q`
  - ✅ Passed (versioned and legacy config endpoints parity verified).
- `uv run pytest tests/api/test_serve.py -q`
  - ❌ Fails during collection: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agno.os'; 'agno' is not a package` because the test fixture patches `sys.modules['agno']` with a plain `MagicMock` and now misses `agno.os` / `agno.os.config` required by the new AgentOS imports.
- Initial combined pytest run timed out after 120s; reran suites individually to gather definitive evidence.

## Findings
- **Group A**: New settings (`hive_embed_playground`, `hive_playground_mount_path`, `hive_control_pane_base_url`, AgentOS toggles) load with backwards-compatible defaults. Startup orchestration now surfaces Playground and Control Pane status correctly, and Docker docs in `docker/README.md` emphasize Hive-hosted routes (legacy `agent-infra-docker/` path still absent, previously noted by implementer).
- **Group B**: `api/serve.py` wraps the unified router behind auth when enabled, and `api/main.py` mirrors the protected `/api/v1` structure while leaving health public. Wish router enforces API key authentication and returns catalog entries.
- **Group C**: AgentOS service enriches `interfaces` with Control Pane, wish catalog, and playground routes; dependency provider cache key accounts for the new settings. README Control Pane section documents the new URLs and overrides.
- **Regression**: `tests/api/test_serve.py` can no longer import `api.serve` under its patched environment. The fixture must stub `agno.os`, `agno.os.config`, and `agno.os.schema` (or avoid over-mocking) to reflect the new dependency footprint. Until addressed, CI will fail and the suite cannot progress to later groups.

## Verdict
- **HOLD** – Group A–C code aligns with the wish intent, but the serve module test harness must be updated to accommodate the additional `agno.os.*` imports. Without that fix the review cannot approve advancing to Groups D–E.

## Follow-ups
- Patch `tests/api/test_serve.py` (or shared fixtures) to provide `agno.os`, `agno.os.config`, and `agno.os.schema` stubs before importing `api.serve`, ensuring compatibility with the expanded AgentOS service imports.
- Consider synchronizing documentation expectations if the legacy `agent-infra-docker/` directory reappears, keeping the wish checklist consistent.
