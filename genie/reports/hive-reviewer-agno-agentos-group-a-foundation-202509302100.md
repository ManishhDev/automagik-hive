# Death Testament – Review: Agno AgentOS Group A Foundation

## Scope Reviewed
- Hive configuration surfaces in `lib/config/settings.py` and `lib/config/server_config.py`.
- Startup summarization pipeline across `lib/utils/startup_orchestration.py` and `lib/utils/startup_display.py`.
- Operator guidance within `docker/README.md` and annotations in `docker/main/docker-compose.yml`.
- Implementer Death Testament `@genie/reports/hive-coder-agno-agentos-foundation-settings-202509302232.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria & Status
- **A1-playground-settings**: ✅ `HiveSettings` now exposes playground/control pane toggles with defaults matching legacy behaviour; `ServerConfig` derives normalized URLs and schema validation without altering runtime defaults.
- **A2-startup-contract**: ✅ Startup orchestration injects a "Runtime Surfaces" table and serializable summary fields covering Playground + AgentOS status, driven by authentication state and config sources.
- **A3-compose-audit**: ✅ Docker docs steer operators toward the Hive-hosted endpoints with environment flag explanations; compose file comments reinforce the Hive API as primary access while leaving services untouched.

## Validation Evidence
- `uv run uvicorn api.serve:app --help` → Help text rendered successfully after config initialization (no runtime errors).
- Manual inspection confirmed surface summaries include URLs, auth indicators, and config fallback messaging.
- Documentation check verified new environment variables and operator guidance surfaced under `docker/` (legacy `agent-infra-docker/` path absent in repo—logged as already noted by implementer).

## Verdict
- **Decision**: PASS — Group A foundation work satisfies its acceptance criteria with defaults preserved and operator guidance updated.
- **Readiness**: Proceed to Groups B and C; downstream tasks can rely on the new settings and startup telemetry.

## Follow-ups & Risks
- Track potential reappearance of `agent-infra-docker/` docs to keep guidance consistent across locations.
- Future phases should add automated coverage around the new surfaces once wish telemetry endpoints land.
