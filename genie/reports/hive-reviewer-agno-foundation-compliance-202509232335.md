# Death Testament – Forge Review: feat: agno v2 foundation migration

## Scope
- Wish: `genie/wishes/agno-v2-migration-wish.md` (Group A1–A4 foundation milestones)
- Forge task: da3a9643-b7f8-412b-9523-f1db4377e6aa – "feat: agno v2 foundation migration"
- Commits inspected: 805b5d72 (primary implementation), 709c427 (memory flag remediation following prior HOLD)
- Focus areas: dependency pinning, storage/proxy refactors to supply Agno v2 `db`/`dependencies`, memory factory alignment, regression fallout from legacy configs

## Assessment
- ✅ Agno version pin verified at `agno==2.0.8`; `pyproject.toml` reflects the lock step while respecting UV guardrails, and runtime import confirms the version.
- ✅ Storage helper now emits Agno v2 constructs. `create_dynamic_storage` resolves `agno.db.*` classes, builds the new table set, and returns `{"db", "dependencies"}` bundles for proxies to consume (`lib/utils/agno_storage_utils.py:56-149`).
- ✅ Agent and team proxies translate legacy flags and surface shared Db handles. Memory handlers reuse shared Db instances and remap deprecated keys to the v2 context flags, preventing the regression noted in the prior review (`lib/utils/proxy_agents.py:478-538`, `lib/utils/proxy_teams.py:394-448`).
- ✅ Memory factory constructs `agno.db.postgres.PostgresDb` instances and raises when env configuration is missing, satisfying the unified Db requirement while keeping table naming consistent (`lib/memory/memory_factory.py:1-118`).
- ✅ Tests assert the new behaviour: proxy suites expect `dependencies["db"]` and legacy flag translation, providing coverage for the compatibility layer (`tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents.py:480-520`, `tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_teams.py:544-572`).
- ⚠️ Coverage plugin still warns about unparsable helper modules during targeted pytest runs; warning existed pre-review and does not stem from these commits but is noted for observability.

## Validation
- `uv run pytest tests/lib/memory/test_memory_factory.py tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents.py tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_teams.py`
  - Result: PASS (121 tests). Coverage emitted known warnings about `lib/utils/error_handlers.py` and `lib/utils/fallback_model.py` being unparsable.
- `uv run python -c "import agno; print(agno.__version__)"`
  - Result: `2.0.8`

## Verdict
PASS – Requirements for the foundation forge task are satisfied, legacy memory behaviour restored, and validation evidence reproduced locally.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Monitor subsequent phases (runtime surfaces, knowledge stack) to ensure additional legacy flags (e.g., team `mode`) receive explicit mappings when those groups execute.
- Track the recurring coverage parsing warnings to avoid masking future signal, though they predate this task.
