# Hive Reviewer Report – Agno v2 Migration Audit

## Scope
- Reviewed wish `genie/wishes/agno-v2-migration-wish.md` with focus on Groups A–D deliverables and prerequisites for Group E.
- Inspected aggregated diff on branch `wish/agno-v2-migration` up to commit 8c68f75.
- Sampled key agent configs, proxy utilities, workflow definitions, and associated tests to confirm Agno v2 alignment.

## Validation
- `uv run python - <<'PY' ...` → confirmed `agno.db.postgres.postgres` import succeeds inside project venv (ensures migration script dependency path is valid).
- `uv run python - <<'PY' ...` (with pymongo stub) → inspected `agno.db.migrations.v1_to_v2.migrate` signature to verify CLI wrapper call compatibility.

## Findings (HOLD)
1. **High – Config/tests still rely on v1 `storage`/`context` schema.** Agent YAMLs remain unchanged (`ai/agents/template-agent/config.yaml` still exposes `storage:` & `context:` blocks), and tests keep asserting legacy attributes (`tests/ai/agents/template-agent/test_template_agent.py:269` expects `.storage` on the agent). Workflow proxy tests also exercise `storage` handlers (`tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_workflows_final.py:11`). Wish Group E4 explicitly requires replacing these with `db`/`dependencies` usage and eliminating `.storage` assertions, so the migration scope is not met.

## Verdict
- **HOLD** – Group E prerequisites are unmet; cannot advance to Group E work until configs/tests adopt the Agno v2 schema.

## Follow-ups
- Update all agent/team/workflow YAML fixtures to use `db` + `dependencies` fields per wish spec, removing legacy `storage`/`context` keys.
- Refresh accompanying tests to assert the new schema (drop `.storage` references, add coverage for `dependencies` and shared `db`).
- Re-run targeted suites (`uv run pytest tests/ai tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_*`) and capture evidence once schema alignment is complete.
