# Hive Reviewer • Death Testament — Agno v2 Migration (Aggregated Review)

- Wish: `@genie/wishes/agno-v2-migration-wish.md`
- Scope: Reviewer synthesis across Groups A–F for the Agno v2 migration. Evidence drawn from implementer and reviewer reports, plus file inspection and config/tests snapshots in this workspace.
- Branch context: Multi-branch forge execution per planning docs; verification focuses on acceptance criteria, guardrails, and uv-only evidence.

### Phase 0 – Context Intake
- Acceptance criteria (excerpted from wish Success Criteria & Validation Checklist):
  - Core libs instantiate with v2 APIs using `dependencies=` and unified `Db`; smoke + unit tests pass.
  - Knowledge system uses `Knowledge` with `contents_db` for deletions; unit + integration tests green.
  - Metrics ingestion remapped to v2 fields and provider metrics; migration script wrapper present and runnable.
  - Proxies/helpers emit v2 `Db` and `dependencies`; drop `context`/`storage` in factories and assets.
  - Agent/team/workflow YAML and tests align to `db` + `dependencies` (no `.storage` assertions).
  - UV-only tooling; no manual `pyproject.toml` edits.
  - Final validation: ruff + mypy gates on touched modules are green; targeted pytest suites pass; migration logs attached.

### Phase 1 – Evidence Gathering (selected artefacts)
- Group A — Foundation
  - Reviewer DT: `@genie/reports/hive-reviewer-agno-foundation-compliance-202509232335.md` → PASS
    - `uv run python -c "import agno; print(agno.__version__)"` → 2.0.8
    - `uv run pytest tests/lib/memory/test_memory_factory.py tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents.py tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_teams.py` → PASS
  - Proxies and memory factory emit v2 `Db`/`dependencies` (legacy flags remapped), per reviewer notes.

- Group B — Runtime surfaces
  - Coder DT: `@genie/reports/hive-coder-agno-v2-runtime-surfaces-202509240010.md` → targeted suites PASS
  - Reviewer DT: `@genie/reports/hive-reviewer-group-b-runtime-surfaces-20250925T1200Z.md` → PASS

- Group C — Knowledge system
  - Early re-reviews showed HOLD; subsequent remediations:
    - Reviewer DT: `@genie/reports/hive-reviewer-knowledge-group-c-20250925T0000Z.md` → PASS for C1–C3
    - Implementer DTs show final results: `@genie/reports/hive-coder-knowledge-agno-pgvector-remediation-202509251436.md` → `uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge -q` → 422 passed, 2 skipped; `uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge -q` → 180 passed
  - Separate reviewer audit notes that ruff/mypy gates still failing for `lib/knowledge/**` (see Phase 2).

- Group D — Persistence & metrics
  - Coder DT: `@genie/reports/hive-coder-agno-v2-migration-dry-run-202509251531.md` → metrics tests PASS; migration wrapper present; dry-run succeeded with transcript claim.
  - Tests present: `tests/lib/metrics/` including `test_agno_metrics_bridge.py`, `test_async_metrics_service.py`.

- Group E — Agent assets
  - Coder DT: `@genie/reports/hive-coder-agno-v2-assets-20250925T1452Z.md` → Template YAMLs use `db` + `dependencies`; proxy tests expect v2 schema; subset tests PASS.
  - Reviewer audit: `@genie/reports/hive-reviewer-agno-v2-audit-202509251548.md` flagged lingering v1 `storage`/`context` references at that time; current workspace snapshot indicates templates are aligned (`ai/agents/template-agent/config.yaml` shows `db` and `dependencies`). Full repo sweep still recommended.

### Phase 2 – Independent Validation (re-run essentials; cross-check guardrails)
- UV-only guardrail observed across reports; no manual `pyproject.toml` edits reported for these scopes.
- Knowledge static gates (from reviewer `…alignment-wish-20250925T1412Z.md`):
  - Ruff: issues like S324 (intentional MD5), S110. Action: local `# noqa` or refactor with compatibility notes.
  - Mypy: missing stubs and typing corrections. Action: add `pandas-stubs`, `types-PyYAML`, `types-tqdm` (dev) and annotate call sites until green.
- Migration execution: script wrapper exists and dry-run validated; a real staging run with `HIVE_DATABASE_URL` and pre/post row counts must be executed and attached per wish D1/D3 success criteria.
- Agent assets: current templates appear v2-compliant; require a repo-wide schema sweep plus rerun of `tests/ai` and proxy suites to lock E1–E4.

### Phase 3 – Verdict & Reporting
- Verdict: HOLD
  - Justification:
    - Knowledge static analysis gates (ruff + mypy for `lib/knowledge/**`) are not green per reviewer evidence; the wish requires these checks to pass prior to completion.
    - Migration wrapper has only dry-run evidence; the wish calls for staging execution with logs (pre/post counts) attached.
    - Need a repo-wide confirmation that no v1 `storage`/`context` references remain in YAML/tests; subset checks look good but full validation is pending.

### Validation Commands (to finalize; run via uv)
```bash
# Static gates for knowledge
uv sync
uv add --dev pandas-stubs types-PyYAML types-tqdm
uv run ruff check lib/knowledge --fix
uv run mypy lib/knowledge

# Agent assets + proxies
uv run pytest tests/ai -q
uv run pytest tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_agents.py tests/lib/utils/test_proxy_teams.py -q

# Migration wrapper (dry-run + staging)
uv run python scripts/agno_db_migrate_v2.py --dry-run
# With HIVE_DATABASE_URL and env set for staging:
uv run python scripts/agno_db_migrate_v2.py

# Final sweep
uv run ruff check lib/ api/ ai/
uv run mypy lib/knowledge lib/memory lib/utils
uv run pytest -q
```

### Required Follow-ups (delegations)
- hive-quality: Resolve ruff/mypy for `lib/knowledge/**` (apply stubs, annotations, or localized `# noqa` with justification) until green.
- hive-coder: Ensure all YAML/tests across `ai/**` use `db` + `dependencies`; remove `.storage`/`context` assumptions; update any proxy/workflow fixtures accordingly.
- hive-tests: Re-run `tests/ai` and proxy suites; provide logs. Add targeted assertions for `dependencies` presence where applicable.
- hive-coder (ops): Execute non–dry-run migration in staging; attach transcript with pre/post counts for sessions/memories/metrics/knowledge/evals to `@genie/reports/`.
- Genie: Update wish validation checklist in `@genie/wishes/agno-v2-migration-wish.md` and flip Status to COMPLETED after all above are green with artefacts linked.

### Risks & Assumptions
- Risk: Static typing fixes may uncover latent edge-cases in knowledge loaders; mitigate with targeted unit tests.
- Risk: Non–dry-run migration on staging may surface environment credential issues; ensure robust logging and rollback notes.
- Assumption: Current templates reflect latest v2 schema; remaining v1 references (if any) are limited to stragglers detectable via grep and tests.
