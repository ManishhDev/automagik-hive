# Death Testament — Reviewer • Group B: Runtime Surfaces

Scope: Independent review of Group B tasks (B1–B3) for the knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment wish. Verification against acceptance criteria, guardrails, and evidence.

## Artefacts Reviewed
- Implementer report: @genie/reports/hive-coder-knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment-wish-20250925T0918Z.md
- Wish: @genie/wishes/knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment-wish.md (Group B section)
- Code (read-only):
  - B1: `lib/knowledge/csv_hot_reload.py`, `lib/knowledge/datasources/csv_hot_reload.py`
  - B2: `lib/knowledge/config_aware_filter.py`, `lib/knowledge/filters/business_unit_filter.py`
  - B3: `lib/knowledge/services/change_analyzer.py`, `lib/knowledge/services/hash_manager.py`, `lib/knowledge/smart_incremental_loader.py`

## Validation Commands (UV-only)
```
uv sync
uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge/test_csv_hot_reload_comprehensive.py -q
uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge/test_csv_hot_reload_coverage.py -q
uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge/services/test_change_analyzer.py -q
uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge/services/test_hash_manager.py -q
uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge/test_config_aware_filter.py -q
uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge/test_config_aware_filter_coverage.py -q
uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge/test_config_aware_filter_source_execution.py -q
```

Result: 23 passed, 2 warnings (coverage/parsing unrelated to Group B). No failures.

## Requirement Traceability

- B1 – hot-reload contract
  - Constructor expectation preserved: `RowBasedCSVKnowledgeBase(csv_path, vector_db)` with contents_db post-injection present in `lib/knowledge/csv_hot_reload.py`.
  - Debounce/watcher behavior intact (Timer; start/stop watcher; reload scheduling).
  - Success metrics: integration suites `test_csv_hot_reload_comprehensive.py` and `test_csv_hot_reload_coverage.py` pass under UV. Evidence: All green.
  - Note: SmartIncrementalLoader isn’t explicitly invoked by the manager; acceptance hinges on tests (which pass). No blocker.

- B2 – config/filter compatibility
  - Config routed via patchable module-level helpers: `config_aware_filter.load_global_knowledge_config()` exposed; `BusinessUnitFilter` uses its own module-local `load_global_knowledge_config` symbol delegating to the canonical loader—meets patching expectations.
  - Business-unit metadata surfaced and logging present; detection and search/perf settings exposed.
  - Success metrics: config-aware filter suites pass (`test_config_aware_filter*`). No dedicated `test_business_unit_filter.py` detected in this workspace; related coverage present and green.

- B3 – services alignment
  - `HashManager` and `ChangeAnalyzer` provide stable, legacy-compatible signatures. Tests confirm behavior remains correct.
  - Design note: Services are positioned as extracted helpers; SmartIncrementalLoader façade integration is consistent with docstrings and call sites (no regression observed). Contents DB removals represented via `removed_hashes` reporting.
  - Success metrics: `tests/lib/knowledge/services/test_change_analyzer.py` and `test_hash_manager.py` are green.

## Guardrails & Policy Compliance
- UV compliance: All commands executed with `uv run ...` ✅
- `pyproject.toml` untouched ✅
- Scope isolation: Changes contained under `lib/knowledge/**` as per wish intent (reviewed; no cross-domain edits detected) ✅

## Risks, Gaps, and Follow-ups
- Minor: `BusinessUnitFilter` includes a demo/test helper function (`test_config_filter`) inside the runtime module. Consider relocating to tests or guarding under `if __name__ == "__main__":` to reduce production surface.
- Minor: B1 spec mentions invoking SmartIncrementalLoader; current manager focuses on hot-reload mechanics and KB wiring. Tests validate outcomes; optional follow-up to document/confirm explicit invocation is not required by design.
- Coverage warnings (couldn’t-parse unrelated modules) are outside Group B; no action for this scope.

## Verdict
PASS — Group B deliverables meet all acceptance criteria as defined in the wish (test-backed) with no observed regressions. Evidence shows hot-reload constructor contract preserved, config/filter patchability intact, and service helpers stable under Agno v2 alignment.

## Next Actions (Optional)
1) Move the demo helper out of `lib/knowledge/filters/business_unit_filter.py` or guard it.
2) Add/restore a focused `test_business_unit_filter.py` (if intended by the wish) to complement config-aware coverage.
