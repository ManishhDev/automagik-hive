# Death Testament — hive-reviewer — knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment

## Scope
- Reviewed `genie/wishes/knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment-wish.md` for success criteria, guardrails, and validation checklist alignment with Agno v2 migration prerequisites.
- Audited implementation evidence from `genie/reports/hive-coder-knowledge-agno-pgvector-remediation-202509251436.md`, focusing on SmartIncrementalLoader compatibility, contents DB handing, and static analysis debt removal.
- Inspected key knowledge modules (`lib/knowledge/smart_incremental_loader.py`, `lib/knowledge/row_based_csv_knowledge.py`, `lib/knowledge/csv_hot_reload.py`, `lib/knowledge/repositories/knowledge_repository.py`) for contract guarantees needed by the forthcoming Agno v2 wish.

## Acceptance Criteria Traceability
1. **Knowledge unit suites restored** — Implementer ran `uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge -q` with `422 passed, 2 skipped`, satisfying Wish ✅1 (smart loader, datasource, repository suites). Evidence: Death Testament Validation Log §3.
2. **Integration suites & hot reload constructors stable** — `uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge -q` → `180 passed`; hot reload constructor expectations maintained. Evidence: Death Testament Validation Log §4. ✅2
3. **RowBasedCSVKnowledgeBase exposes stable helpers** — Verified `build_document_from_row`, `get_signature`, and contents DB post-construction wiring in current HEAD (`lib/knowledge/row_based_csv_knowledge.py:246`, `lib/knowledge/csv_hot_reload.py:107`). These implement the adapter pattern promised in the Wish narrative. ✅3
4. **Smart incremental loads keep pgvector + contents DB in sync** — Repository coordination uses `remove_content_by_id` with transactional safeguards (`lib/knowledge/repositories/knowledge_repository.py:104`, `:262`), and loader delegates hash population/order while preserving legacy logging. Matches Wish Success Criterion 4. ✅4
5. **Static analysis parity** — Ruff + mypy now clean per Death Testament Validation Log §1–2; stub dependencies added for typing parity (pyproject + uv.lock updated accordingly). ✅5

## Additional Findings & Risks
- Wish doc still marked `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; once we advance, update status + validation checklist with the passing command outputs for archival completeness.
- New stub dependencies (`pandas-stubs`, `types-pyyaml`, `types-tqdm`) introduced through uv workflow; ensure downstream tooling (CI) runs `uv sync` before next migrations so typings resolve.
- Coverage warnings noted in Validation Log remain legacy tech debt; they do not block Agno v2 migration but should stay on backlog.

## Verdict
PASS — Implementation meets all enumerated success criteria, no regressions detected, and the knowledge stack now provides the compatibility layer required for Agno v2 migration phases.

## Follow-ups
1. Update `genie/wishes/knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment-wish.md` with completion status, linked Death Testaments, and checkbox confirmations.
2. Confirm CI/automation environments execute `uv sync` to pick up stub dependencies before scheduling Agno v2 migrations.

## Validation Artefacts
- `genie/reports/hive-coder-knowledge-agno-pgvector-remediation-202509251436.md`
- Commands documented therein (`uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge -q`, `uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge -q`, `uv run ruff check lib/knowledge`, `uv run mypy lib/knowledge`).
