# Death Testament — hive-reviewer — knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment-wish

Branch: wish/agno-v2-migration (worktree fork)
Environment: macOS 13 (darwin 22.3.0), CPython 3.12.11 via uv

## Scope
- Review the wish `@genie/wishes/knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment-wish.md` and the latest implementer Death Testament `@genie/reports/hive-coder-knowledge-agno-pgvector-alignment-wish-20250925T1057Z.md`.
- Validate whether success criteria are met (tests, integration, ruff, mypy) to authorize moving forward to Agno v2 migration.
- Record independent validation evidence using uv-only tooling.

## Acceptance Criteria (from wish)
1) uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge -q: PASS
2) uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge -q: PASS
3) RowBasedCSVKnowledgeBase exposes stable helpers; SmartIncrementalLoader BWC facade works; hot-reload constructor expectations preserved: PASS indicated by tests
4) Consistent pgvector + contents DB update/remove semantics with logging: validated via integration tests
5) Ruff + mypy clean for lib/knowledge modules: REQUIRED to be green before proceeding

## Independent Validation (uv-only)
Commands executed:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/lib/knowledge -q
uv run pytest tests/integration/knowledge -q
uv run ruff check lib/knowledge
uv run mypy lib/knowledge
```
Results:
- Knowledge unit tests: PASS (422 passed, 2 skipped)
- Knowledge integration tests: PASS (180 passed)
- Ruff (knowledge): FAILED with 7 issues
  - S608 (SQL construction) at knowledge_factory.py:48, 248; knowledge_repository.py:273
  - S324 (md5) at hash_manager.py:45; smart_incremental_loader.py:69, 280 (intentional legacy compatibility per implementer DT)
  - S110 (try/except/pass) at smart_incremental_loader.py:426
- Mypy (knowledge): FAILED with 58 errors across 11 files (missing stubs for pandas/yaml/tqdm, Row[Any] indexing, missing annotations, Optional defaults, create_engine arg types, etc.)

## Analysis & Alignment
- Tests meet criteria (both unit and integration knowledge suites pass), demonstrating runtime alignment of adapters and hot-reload contracts.
- Static analysis gates do not meet the wish’s Success Criteria (E2). The wish explicitly requires Ruff + mypy to exit cleanly for knowledge modules before declaring completion and moving forward to migration.
- Implementer DT acknowledges remaining Ruff/Mypy items and suggests adding typing stubs; however, those changes are not present and current runs remain red for static checks.

## Risks & Considerations
- S608 flags are legitimate; while usage is likely constrained, they should be parameterized or suppressed with rationale near callsites.
- MD5 usage (S324) is intentional for hash stability; add localized `# noqa: S324` with justification or migrate to stronger hashing with a compatibility window (requires broader decision/testing).
- Mypy errors include third-party stub gaps (pandas-stubs, types-PyYAML, types-tqdm) and typing correctness; these are remediable without functional risk.

## Verdict
HOLD — Do not proceed to Agno v2 migration yet. While runtime tests pass, static analysis gating (Ruff + Mypy for `lib/knowledge/**`) remains failing, violating the wish’s Success Criteria.

## Remediation Checklist (delegate back to Genie)
1) Add dev stubs via uv:
   - `uv add --dev pandas-stubs types-PyYAML types-tqdm`
2) Resolve mypy errors in knowledge modules:
   - Fix Row[Any] indexing by checking for None and unpacking
   - Add missing return/arg annotations; remove implicit Optional defaults
   - Tighten `create_engine` argument types and guard None
3) Address Ruff findings:
   - Parameterize SQL (use bindparams, schema/table validation) or add `# noqa: S608` with justification
   - Add `# noqa: S324` where MD5 is intentionally required for legacy stability
   - Replace `try/except/pass` with explicit logging
4) Re-run:
   - `uv run ruff check lib/knowledge` → clean
   - `uv run mypy lib/knowledge` → clean
   - Confirm tests remain green

Once all four gates are green, update the wish status to COMPLETED with linked evidence and proceed to the Agno v2 migration workstream.
