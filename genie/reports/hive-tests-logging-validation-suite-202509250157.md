# Hive Tests Death Testament – logging-validation-suite (2025-09-25T01:57Z)

## Scope & Outcomes
- Authored verification coverage for Group 3 of the logging-level-consistency wish.
- Added regression tests confirming INFO default suppresses DEBUG chatter and explicit DEBUG opt-in emits breadcrumbs.
- Extended CLI smoke coverage to assert `ServiceManager` initialization honors logging level contracts and persists sampled output for evidence.

## Test Assets
- `tests/lib/logging/test_level_enforcement.py`: new module covering INFO and DEBUG behaviors with file-backed log samples.
- `tests/cli/commands/test_service.py`: added `TestServiceManagerLoggingLevels` for CLI bootstrap guardrails.

## Commands Executed
```bash
# RED – attempted run failed: sandbox blocked uv cache access
uv run pytest tests/lib/logging/test_level_enforcement.py -q

# RED – attempted run failed: network fetch for openai wheel denied under restricted DNS
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run pytest tests/lib/logging/test_level_enforcement.py -q

# GREEN – offline execution of logging validation suite
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache UV_NO_SYNC=1 uv run --offline pytest tests/lib/logging/test_level_enforcement.py -q

# GREEN – targeted CLI logging guard coverage
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache UV_NO_SYNC=1 uv run --offline pytest tests/cli/commands/test_service.py -k "LoggingLevels" -q
```
- Coverage plugin emitted existing warnings about unparsable legacy modules (`lib/utils/error_handlers.py`, `lib/utils/fallback_model.py`). No new regressions observed.

## Evidence & Observations
- INFO baseline run captured to `tmp_path/info_default.log` contains only INFO payloads; DEBUG breadcrumb absent.
- DEBUG opt-in run captured to `tmp_path/debug_opt_in.log` contains both the user DEBUG marker and `Logging bootstrap complete` breadcrumb.
- CLI smoke tests persist `cli_info_bootstrap.log` and `cli_debug_bootstrap.log`, mirroring the global suite expectations and guaranteeing absence/presence of the bootstrap breadcrumb per env.

## Risks & Follow-ups
- Network-restricted environments must keep using `UV_NO_SYNC=1` + `--offline` toggles until caches include third-party wheels.
- Coverage parser warnings remain outstanding from legacy modules; flagged for future cleanup but unrelated to this suite.

## Handoff Notes
- Wish evidence should reference this testament alongside the log sample assertions in the new tests.
- No production modules modified; downstream implementation agent can rely on these tests as RED guardrails if regressions reappear.
