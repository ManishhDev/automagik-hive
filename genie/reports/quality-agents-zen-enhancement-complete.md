## âœ… COMPLETED ENHANCEMENTS

### genie-quality-ruff Zen Integration
- **Phase 0 Zen Assessment**: Universal 1-10 complexity scoring with ruff-specific indicators
- **Smart Escalation**: Only complexity >= 7 triggers zen consensus for policy conflicts  
- **Expert Policy Validation**: Multi-model consensus for conflicting rules and performance trade-offs
- **Zen-Informed Operations**: Expert-validated vs. standard formatting strategies
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Zen metrics integrated into completion reports
- **Learning Capture**: Successful zen patterns documented for cross-session use

### genie-quality-mypy Zen Integration  
- **Sophisticated Type Complexity**: Enhanced scoring with type-specific indicators
- **Dual Zen Pathways**: 
  - Complexity >= 9: Multi-expert consensus for critical type architecture decisions
  - Complexity >= 7: Zen analyze for complex type pattern analysis
- **Expert Type Guidance**: Zen-validated type resolution approaches and annotation patterns
- **Architecture Insights**: Expert analysis for complex type system decisions
- **Description Enhancement**: Updated to reflect zen-enhanced capabilities

## ðŸ§  ZEN INTEGRATION APPROACH

### Minimal Zen Philosophy Applied
The enhancement follows the "minimal zen integration" approach from the zen mastery plan:
- **Efficiency Preservation**: Ultra-focused operations maintained for standard scenarios
- **Smart Escalation**: Zen tools only triggered for genuinely complex scenarios
- **Expert Validation**: Multi-model analysis for policy conflicts and architecture decisions
- **Orchestration Compliance**: Domain boundaries and hierarchical respect preserved

### Complexity Assessment Framework
```python
# Universal complexity assessment implemented
def assess_quality_complexity(context: dict, domain: str) -> int:
    """1-10 complexity scoring for quality operations"""
    
    # Domain-specific complexity indicators
    if domain == "ruff":
        indicators = ["conflicting_rules", "legacy_patterns", "performance_impact", "codebase_size"]
    elif domain == "mypy":
        indicators = ["generic_variance", "protocol_conflicts", "circular_imports", "async_issues"]
    
    # Scoring logic: >= 7 triggers zen escalation
    return calculate_complexity_score(indicators)
```

### Zen Tool Selection Matrix
```python
quality_zen_triggers = {
    # Ruff scenarios
    "formatting_policy_conflicts": "mcp__zen__consensus",
    "legacy_compatibility_decisions": "mcp__zen__analyze", 
    "performance_formatting_trade_offs": "mcp__zen__consensus",
    
    # MyPy scenarios  
    "critical_type_architecture": "mcp__zen__consensus",    # Complexity >= 9
    "complex_type_patterns": "mcp__zen__analyze",           # Complexity >= 7
    "protocol_design_decisions": "mcp__zen__consensus",
    
    # Standard operations
    "routine_formatting": None,
    "simple_type_fixes": None
}
```
