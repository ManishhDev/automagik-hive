# Epic: API Architecture Cleanup - Agno Standards Alignment
*Generated from research into API parameter handling and architectural compliance*

## Metadata
- **Epic ID**: api-architecture-cleanup
- **Type**: refactor
- **Priority**: high
- **Branch**: epic/api-architecture-cleanup
- **Created**: 2025-07-16
- **Status**: draft

## Overview
A comprehensive architectural refactoring to eliminate duplicate API routing systems and align our implementation with Agno Playground standards. Our investigation revealed we're running two parallel API systems - Agno's standard endpoints AND our custom middleware/extensions - creating significant technical debt, performance overhead, and maintenance burden.

The goal is to simplify our architecture by adopting pure Agno patterns, eliminating 600+ lines of duplicate routing logic, and leveraging the framework's native capabilities for better performance, documentation, and developer experience.

## Context & Background

### Current State
Our API architecture has evolved into a complex hybrid system with multiple routing layers:

**Primary Issues Identified:**
1. **Dual API Stack**: Both `PlaygroundVersionMiddleware` and `playground_extensions.py` implement near-identical version handling
2. **Non-Standard Parameters**: Workflows use custom parameter names (`conversation_text`, `customer_message`) instead of Agno standards (`message`, `workflow_input`)
3. **Technical Debt**: 600+ lines in `playground_extensions.py` that recreate Agno functionality
4. **Performance Overhead**: Double routing through middleware → extensions → actual Agno endpoints
5. **Request Body Bug**: Middleware consumes request body but forwards already-consumed request on fallback
6. **Blocking Operations**: Heavy DB/LLM work performed synchronously in middleware chain

**Current Architecture Flow:**
```
Client Request → Version Middleware → Custom Extensions → Agno Playground → Components
```

### Desired State
A clean, standards-compliant API architecture that leverages Agno's native capabilities:

**Target Architecture:**
```
Client Request → Agno Playground → Components (with native versioning)
```

**Benefits of Clean Implementation:**
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Built-in parameter validation
- Standard monitoring integration
- Simplified development patterns
- Future-proof architecture with Agno updates
- Better performance through single routing layer

### Technical Context
- **Architecture Decision**: Move to pure Agno implementation with native versioning
- **Pattern References**: Standard Agno Playground patterns from framework documentation
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain backward compatibility during transition

## Scope

### In Scope
- Eliminate duplicate routing infrastructure (middleware + extensions)

## Technical Specifications

### Current Architecture Analysis
**Problematic Components:**
- `/api/middleware/version_middleware.py` - Intercepts requests and duplicates routing logic
- `/api/routes/playground_extensions.py` - 600+ lines recreating Agno functionality
- Custom parameter patterns in workflow signatures
- Database-driven versioning that bypasses Agno native capabilities

**Agno Standard Patterns:**
- `playground.get_async_router()` for endpoint auto-generation
- Standard parameter contracts: `message` for agents/teams, `workflow_input` for workflows
- Built-in version routing through component metadata
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation

### Target Architecture
**Clean Implementation:**
```python
# Standard Agno Playground setup
playground = Playground(
    agents=agents_list,
    teams=teams_list,
    workflows=workflows_list,
    name="PagBank Multi-Agent System"
)

# Single router with all capabilities
unified_router = playground.get_async_router()
app.include_router(unified_router)
```

**Parameter Standardization:**
```python
# Current (to be deprecated)
workflow.run(conversation_text="...", customer_message="...")

# Target (standard Agno)
workflow.run(workflow_input={
    "conversation_text": "...",
    "customer_message": "..."
})
```

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Breaking Changes**: Potential disruption to existing API clients
  - *Mitigation*: Implement backward compatibility shims during transition
- **Performance Regressions**: Changes could negatively impact response times
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive performance testing at each phase

### Medium Risks
- **Version Functionality Loss**: Custom versioning features might not map to Agno native
  - *Mitigation*: Thorough research of Agno capabilities before migration
- **Documentation Gaps**: Loss of custom documentation during standardization
  - *Mitigation*: Ensure Agno's auto-generated docs cover all use cases

### Low Risks
- **Development Velocity**: Temporary slowdown during refactoring
  - *Mitigation*: Phase implementation to minimize impact
