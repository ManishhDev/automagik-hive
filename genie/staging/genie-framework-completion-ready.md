# EPIC READY FOR SPAWN

The genie-framework-completion epic is ready to spawn tasks. 

## Key Adjustments Based on Testing:

1. **Memory System**: Works for one-way communication (Main â†’ Subagents)
   - Subagents can read but not write
   - Will use hybrid approach: memory + files

2. **WhatsApp**: Has asyncio issue, being fixed
   - Won't block other development
   - Will implement once fixed

3. **Proceed with**:
   - Context automation hooks
   - Command consolidation
   - CLAUDE.md refactoring
   - Planning enhancements

Ready to use /spawn-tasks to begin development!
