# Task: T-001 - Explore genie-memory capabilities

## Epic: genie-framework-completion
## Continuation ID: epic-genie-framework-completion-7a3f2b4c/T-001
## Status: [ðŸ”„] ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
## Dependencies: none

## Description
Test mem0-based memory system for inter-agent communication and context persistence. Based on initial tests, we know subagents have read-only access.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Test memory storage/retrieval patterns thoroughly
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Design hybrid memory + file architecture
- Create memory wrapper functions

## Context Continuity
When working on this task, use continuation ID for all Zen tool calls:
```python
continuation_id="epic-genie-framework-completion-7a3f2b4c/T-001"
```

## Memory Patterns to Test
1. **Breadcrumb Pattern**: Main leaves trail, subs read
2. **Error Repository**: Store errorâ†’solution mappings  
3. **Planning Context**: Share high-level decisions
4. **Discovery Aggregation**: Subs return, main stores
5. **Search Patterns**: Test search effectiveness

## Technical Context
- Memory system is one-way: Main â†’ Subagents
- Subagents can search and read all memories
- Only main agent can write memories
- Consider hybrid approach with filesystem
