9. **`genie/task-cards/shared/00-platform-context.md`**
   - **Purpose**: Shared context for all implementation tasks
   - **Review for**: Consistent understanding across all tasks
   - **Key questions**: Is context sufficient for any agent to start work?

10. **Phase 1 Tasks** (Foundation - can run in parallel):
    - `genie/task-cards/phase1/01-refactor-ana-team.md`
    - `genie/task-cards/phase1/02-database-infrastructure.md`  
    - `genie/task-cards/phase1/03-base-api-structure.md`
    - `genie/task-cards/phase1/04-migrate-agents.md`
    - **Review for**: Task clarity, implementation steps, validation methods
    - **Key questions**: Can each task be executed independently? Are validation steps sufficient?

11. **Phase 2 Tasks** (Platform Core):
    - `genie/task-cards/phase2/01-agent-versioning.md`
    - `genie/task-cards/phase2/02-typification-workflow.md`
    - `genie/task-cards/phase2/03-configuration-hotreload.md`
    - **Review for**: Platform feature completeness, integration points
    - **Key questions**: Do these create a working platform? How do they integrate?

12. **Phase 3 Tasks** (Production Features):
    - `genie/task-cards/phase3/01-enhanced-monitoring.md`
    - `genie/task-cards/phase3/02-advanced-playground.md`
    - `genie/task-cards/phase3/03-security-compliance.md`
    - **Review for**: Production readiness, scalability, security
    - **Key questions**: Is this production-ready? What's missing for enterprise use?

### Phase 4: Supporting Documentation
**Review supporting materials and coordination**

13. **`genie/task-cards/shared/` files** (in any order):
    - `01-api-endpoints.md`
    - `02-folder-structure.md`
    - `03-yaml-configurations.md`
    - `04-database-schema.md`
    - `05-config-migration.md`
    - `06-database-api.md`
    - `07-dependencies.md`
    - `08-implementation-timeline.md`
    - **Review for**: Consistency across shared resources, completeness
    - **Key questions**: Do shared resources support all tasks? Any conflicts?

14. **`genie/active/agent-coordination.md`**
    - **Purpose**: Multi-agent coordination protocol for parallel execution
    - **Review for**: Coordination effectiveness, conflict resolution, status tracking
    - **Key questions**: Will 6 agents coordinate well? Is the wait/dependency system robust?

15. **`@genie/reference/context-search-tools.md`**
    - **Purpose**: How agents should use MCP tools for Agno questions
    - **Review for**: Tool usage patterns, question strategies
    - **Key questions**: Will agents get good answers from Agno docs? Are patterns clear?

### Phase 5: Investigation Tasks
**Review pending research and unknowns**

16. **`genie/active/agno-parameter-investigation.md`**
    - **Purpose**: Task for separate agent to investigate Agno parameters deeply
    - **Review for**: Investigation strategy, completeness of questions
    - **Key questions**: Will this investigation fill all knowledge gaps? Are instructions clear?
