# Technical Specification Document: Docker SDK Migration

## 1. OVERVIEW

**Objective**: Migrate from Docker subprocess calls to Docker SDK for Python (`docker-py`) to eliminate subprocess brittleness, improve reliability, and enhance developer experience with type safety and structured error handling.

**Success Metrics**: 
- 100% subprocess Docker calls replaced with SDK calls
- >50% performance improvement in Docker operations
- Zero shell injection vulnerabilities
- Type-safe Docker operations with IDE support
- Structured error handling with graceful failure modes
- Maintainable, testable Docker integration code

**Current Pain Points**:
- Subprocess timeout issues and hanging operations
- Shell injection security vulnerabilities
- Poor error handling with raw exit codes
- No type safety or IDE autocompletion
- Difficult to test Docker operations
- Platform-specific subprocess behavior differences

## 2. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Core Features

- **Container Lifecycle Management**: Start, stop, restart, remove containers with robust error handling
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: All container operations return typed results with success/failure status
  - **Current Issue**: subprocess.run() can hang or fail unpredictably

- **Container Information Retrieval**: Get detailed container metadata, status, logs, and health information
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Rich container objects with structured data access
  - **Current Issue**: Parsing raw JSON/text output from docker inspect

- **Service Health Monitoring**: Monitor container health status with real-time updates
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Health checks return structured ServiceHealth objects
  - **Current Issue**: Unreliable health status parsing from subprocess output

- **Resource Management**: Clean up containers, images, and volumes programmatically
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Batch operations with rollback capabilities
  - **Current Issue**: Multiple subprocess calls for resource cleanup

### User Stories

- As a **developer**, I want Docker operations to be type-safe so that I get IDE autocompletion and catch errors at compile time
- As a **system administrator**, I want reliable container management so that services don't fail due to subprocess timeouts
- As a **security engineer**, I want Docker operations to be safe from shell injection so that the system remains secure
- As a **DevOps engineer**, I want structured error handling so that I can build robust automation workflows

## 3. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **Response Time**: Docker operations should complete 2-5x faster than subprocess equivalents
- **Throughput**: Support concurrent Docker operations without blocking
- **Scalability**: Handle 100+ container operations per minute reliably

### Security
- **Shell Safety**: Zero shell injection vulnerabilities (no subprocess shell=True)
- **Authentication**: Support Docker daemon authentication via SDK
- **Resource Isolation**: Proper resource cleanup and connection management

### Reliability
- **Availability**: 99.9% operation success rate under normal conditions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with typed exceptions
- **Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

## 4. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### System Components

- **DockerSDKManager**: Central Docker operations manager with connection pooling
  - **Responsibilities**: Container lifecycle, health monitoring, resource management
  - **Interfaces**: Typed methods for all Docker operations with structured return types

- **ContainerService**: High-level container abstraction layer
  - **Responsibilities**: Service-specific operations (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
  - **Interfaces**: Service-aware health checks and configuration management

- **MigrationAdapter**: Compatibility layer for gradual migration
  - **Responsibilities**: Backwards compatibility during transition period
  - **Interfaces**: Drop-in replacement for existing subprocess functions

### Data Models

```python
@dataclass
class ContainerInfo:
    """Rich container information structure"""
    id: str
    name: str
    image: str
    state: ContainerState
    status: str
    ports: Dict[str, Any]
    labels: Dict[str, str]
    created: str
    started: Optional[str] = None

@dataclass
class ServiceHealth:
    """Service health monitoring structure"""
    name: str
    container_id: str
    state: ContainerState
    health_status: Optional[str]
    last_health_check: Optional[str]
    is_ready: bool

class DockerSDKManager:
    """Main Docker SDK integration class"""
    
    def get_container_info(self, name_or_id: str) -> Optional[ContainerInfo]:
        """Get structured container information"""
        
    def start_container(self, image: str, name: str, **config) -> Optional[Container]:
        """Start container with full configuration support"""
        
    def wait_for_healthy(self, name_or_id: str, timeout: int = 60) -> bool:
        """Wait for container health with timeout"""
```

### Migration Strategy API Contracts

```python
# Current subprocess approach (TO BE REPLACED)
def old_start_postgres_service(workspace_path: str) -> bool:
    result = subprocess.run([
        "docker", "compose", "-f", compose_file, "up", "-d", "postgres"
    ], capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=120)
    return result.returncode == 0

# New SDK approach (TARGET IMPLEMENTATION)
def new_start_postgres_service(workspace_path: str) -> bool:
    sdk = DockerSDKManager()
    container = sdk.start_container(
        image="agnohq/pgvector:16",
        name="hive-postgres",
        ports={"5432": 5532},
        environment=load_postgres_env(),
        volumes=create_postgres_volumes(),
        restart_policy={"Name": "unless-stopped"}
    )
    return container is not None and sdk.wait_for_healthy("hive-postgres")
```

## 5. TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

### Red-Green-Refactor Integration

**Red Phase**: Write failing tests for Docker SDK operations
```python
def test_docker_sdk_container_lifecycle():
    """Test complete container lifecycle with Docker SDK"""
    sdk = DockerSDKManager()
    
    # Test container creation
    container = sdk.start_container(
        image="alpine:latest",
        name="test-container",
        detach=True
    )
    assert container is not None
    assert container.status == "running"
    
    # Test container info retrieval
    info = sdk.get_container_info("test-container")
    assert info.name == "test-container"
    assert info.state == ContainerState.RUNNING
    
    # Test container cleanup
    success = sdk.stop_container("test-container")
    assert success == True
```

**Green Phase**: Implement minimal Docker SDK functionality
- Core DockerSDKManager class with basic operations
- Container lifecycle methods (start, stop, info)
- Basic error handling and connection management

**Refactor Phase**: Enhance with advanced features
