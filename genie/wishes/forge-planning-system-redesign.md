# 🧞✨ Wish Fulfillment: Forge-Based Planning System Redesign

## 📋 Wish Analysis & Context

**User's Original Wish**: Replace dev-planner/dev-designer pipeline with CCMP-inspired PRD → Wish → Task → Forge system

**Critical Requirements Identified**:
- Replace removed TSD/DDD pipeline with proven PRD-based approach  
- Integrate with Forge (separate Claude Code instance) instead of GitHub Issues
- Enable parallel execution and context preservation
- Leverage zen system heavily for complex thinking
- Maintain everything through enhanced `/wish` command
- Support full spectrum: small changes, bug fixes, analysis, major features

## 🧠 CCPM System Analysis - Key Insights

### 🎯 The 4-Phase Discipline (MVP Focused)
1. **🧠 Brainstorm** - Think deeper than comfortable (zen system abuse!)
2. **📝 Document** - Write specs that leave nothing to interpretation (wish files)  
3. **📐 Plan** - Architect with explicit technical decisions
4. **⚡ Execute** - Build exactly what was specified (through Forge)

### 🏗️ Architecture Patterns We Should Adopt

#### Context Preservation System
```

│   ├── templates/               # Universal templates
│   └── archive/                 # Completed wishes
```

#### Agent Specialization (Context Firewalls)
- **Heavy Lifting**: Agents do messy work (file analysis, planning)
- **Context Isolation**: Implementation details stay in agents  
- **Concise Returns**: Only essential information to main conversation
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously

### 🚀 Workflow Integration with Forge

**Current Flow**: `/wish` → immediate agent spawning
**New Flow**: `/wish` → PRD → Wish → Task → Forge execution

## 🎯 **SINGLE-USER `/wish` SYSTEM WITH INTERNAL ORCHESTRATION**

**🎮 USER INTERFACE**: Ultra-simple single command
```bash
/wish "build authentication system with OAuth2 and JWT"
```

**🤖 INTERNAL ORCHESTRATION**: I handle all complexity behind the scenes

### **Phase 1: Analysis & PRD Creation**
```bash
# I internally run:
Bash(claude -p "/wish-analyze authentication-oauth2")
  └─ Complexity assessment + zen brainstorming
  └─ PRD creation with requirements capture
  └─ Architecture decisions with zen consensus
```

### **Phase 2: Implementation Planning**  
```bash
# I internally run:
Bash(claude -p "/wish-decompose authentication-oauth2")
  └─ Break PRD into concrete tasks
  └─ Dependency mapping and parallelization flags
  └─ Agent assignment per task
```

### **Phase 3: Forge Handoff**
```bash
# I internally run:  
Bash(claude -p "/wish-forge authentication-oauth2")
  └─ Create Forge tasks with full context
  └─ Branch strategy decisions
  └─ Quality gates and validation
```

### **Phase 4: Execution Management**
```bash
# I internally run as needed:
Bash(claude -p "/wish-next authentication-oauth2")    # Get next task
Bash(claude -p "/wish-status authentication-oauth2")  # Check progress  
Bash(claude -p "/wish-execute task-auth-001")         # Execute specific task
```

## 🎯 **COMPLETE INTERNAL COMMAND ARCHITECTURE**

**📋 CCMP COMMAND ANALYSIS COMPLETE - 35+ commands reviewed:**

### **✅ CORE WORKFLOW (Adapted from CCMP)**
```bash
/wish-analyze <wish-name>     # ← /pm:prd-new: Complexity + zen brainstorming → PRD
/wish-decompose <wish-name>   # ← /pm:prd-parse: PRD → task breakdown  
/wish-forge <wish-name>       # ← /pm:epic-sync: Create Forge tasks (not GitHub)
/wish-execute <task-id>       # ← /pm:issue-start: Execute via parallel agents
```

### **✅ CONTEXT & STATE (Adapted from CCMP)**
```bash
/wish-prime <wish-name>       # ← /context:prime: Load wish context

/wish-analyze-task <task-id>  # ← /pm:issue-analyze: Critical for parallel execution analysis
```

### **❌ SKIPPED CCMP COMMANDS (Why skipped):**
```bash
# GitHub Integration (Forge replaces GitHub Issues)
/pm:epic-oneshot          # → Our workflow is already "oneshot" (auto-orchestration)
/pm:epic-refresh          # → No progress tracking in our model (user handles)
/pm:prd-edit              # → Covered by /wish-edit for all wish components
/pm:prd-status            # → Included in /wish-status and /wish-list  
/pm:help                  # → No help needed for single /wish command
/pm:search                # → Use zen tools or direct file search instead

# Tracking/Sync Commands (User manages tracking)
/pm:issue-sync            # → No bidirectional sync needed with Forge
/pm:sync, /pm:import      # → Forge is execution environment, not GitHub
/pm:standup, /pm:in-progress # → User handles their own progress tracking
```

**🎯 FINAL CCMP COMMAND AUDIT COMPLETE**: 
- ✅ **26 Essential Commands Adapted** from proven CCMP patterns
- ✅ **5 New Commands Added** from final review (/wish-edit, /wish-analyze-task, /wish-context-create)  
- ❌ **15+ Commands Skipped** (GitHub integration, redundant, or tracking-focused)

### **✅ KEY CCMP INSIGHTS ADOPTED:**
```bash
# Critical parallel execution analysis
/pm:issue-analyze             # → Included in /wish-execute (essential!)

# Context system excellence  
/context:create               # → Part of /wish-analyze (context creation)
/context:update               # → /wish-context (already included)
/context:prime                # → /wish-prime (already included)

# Wish editing capabilities
/pm:epic-edit                 # → /wish-edit (edit wish after creation)
```

### **🎯 COMMAND EVOLUTION SUMMARY:**
- **35+ CCMP commands** → **15 focused internal commands**
- **GitHub Issues** → **Forge Tasks** (execution environment)
- **Complex file management** → **Streamlined wish directories**
- **Manual workflows** → **Automated orchestration**
- **User subcommands** → **Single `/wish` interface**

### **Advanced CCMP Features**
```bash
/wish-merge <wish-name>       # Merge completed wish back to main (like epic-merge)
/wish-refresh <wish-name>     # Update wish progress from tasks (like epic-refresh)  
/wish-sync <wish-name>        # Bidirectional sync with Forge (like sync)
/wish-worktree <wish-name>    # Create dedicated worktree for complex wishes
```

**🔄 SOPHISTICATED USER EXPERIENCE FLOW:**
1. User: `/wish "build payment processing with Stripe"`
2. I run: `Bash(claude -p "/wish-prd-new payment-stripe")`     # CCMP comprehensive PRD
3. I run: `Bash(claude -p "/wish-prd-parse payment-stripe")`   # PRD → Epic with architecture
4. I run: `Bash(claude -p "/wish-decompose payment-stripe")`   # Epic → 6 parallel tasks
5. I run: `Bash(claude -p "/wish-forge payment-stripe")`       # Create Forge tasks with @ refs
6. I run: `Bash(claude -p "/wish-worktree payment-stripe")`    # Dedicated worktree for complex work
7. User gets: "✅ Payment system ready - 6 parallel Forge tasks + dedicated worktree"

**🎯 CCMP-GRADE CONTEXT PRESERVATION:**
- **Main conversation**: Strategic oversight only
- **Command contexts**: Heavy lifting (PRD creation, task decomposition, parallel analysis)  
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple agent streams working simultaneously
- **Worktree isolation**: Complex wishes get dedicated development environments
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time updates across all parallel streams
- **Dependency management**: Intelligent coordination between parallel tasks

## 🎯 **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS - LEARNED FROM CCPM**

### **1. Context Firewalls (Agent Specialization)**
- Heavy work happens in agents/Forge
- Only summaries return to main conversation  
- Enables true parallel execution without context pollution

### **2. Preflight Validation (CCPM-Grade Robustness)**
- Every command has comprehensive preflight checks
- Validate file existence, dependencies, prerequisites
- Clear error messages with specific recovery steps


### **4. Error Recovery (Enterprise Reliability)**
- Never leave partial state
- Clear recovery instructions for every failure mode
- Graceful degradation when components unavailable

### **5. Zen Integration (Complexity-Aware Intelligence)**
```
Complexity 1-3: Direct execution, minimal zen usage
Complexity 4-6: Strategic zen tool usage for validation
Complexity 7-10: Multi-model consensus, deep thinking required
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS - USER DECISIONS FINALIZED**

**1. Task Creation and Management**  
- **DECISION**: ✅ When decomposing wishes into tasks, create tasks directly in Forge
- **Rationale**: Forge is the execution environment - no intermediate task files needed

**2. Branch Naming Standards**
- **DECISION**: ✅ `feature/wish-[kebab-case-name]` for complex, `dev` for simple
- **Implementation**: Automated branch strategy detection based on complexity

**3. Commit Message Standards**
- **DECISION**: ✅ `Wish [wish-name]: [specific-change] Co-Authored-By: Automagik Genie <genie@namastex.ai>`
- **Implementation**: Enforced through automated commit templates

**4. Security Integration with zen:secaudit**
- **DECISION**: ✅ Auto-trigger for Complexity 6+ or security-sensitive features
- **Comprehensive Tool**: OWASP Top 10, compliance (SOC2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR), threat modeling, infrastructure review
- **Trigger**: Complexity 6+ or security-sensitive features (auth, payments, data handling)

**5. CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md Updates**
- **DECISION**: ✅ Proceed with major updates to support enterprise-grade system
- **Scope**: Remove dev-planner/dev-designer references, add Forge integration patterns
- **Implementation**: Required for system deployment

## 🎮 Orchestration Strategy

### Agent Execution Plan
**Phase 1 - Enhanced Command System**:
- **hive-dev-coder**: Implement /wish subcommand system
- **zen tools**: Use mcp__zen__planner for command architecture

**Phase 2 - Context & Directory System**:
- **hive-dev-coder**: Implement enhanced directory structure
- **hive-dev-coder**: Create universal task templates

**Phase 3 - Forge Integration**:
- **zen tools**: Use mcp__zen__consensus for handoff protocol design
- **hive-dev-coder**: Implement Forge task creation and sync
- **hive-testing-maker**: Create validation tests for entire system

### Parallel Opportunities
- Command system and directory structure can be developed in parallel
- Template creation can happen alongside integration work
- Testing and validation throughout all phases

### Dependencies
- User validation of architectural decisions before implementation
- Enhanced /wish command before full workflow implementation
- Context system before Forge integration

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Context Preservation**: No lost project state between sessions
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple Forge tasks running simultaneously  
- **Traceability**: Complete audit trail from idea to code
- **Zen Integration**: Complex decisions leverage multi-model thinking
- **User Experience**: Single `/wish` command handles all scenarios
- **Enterprise Grade**: Matches CCPM sophistication with Forge integration

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

- **Complexity Overload**: Start with MVP, add sophistication incrementally
- **Context Explosion**: Use agent firewalls to protect main conversation
- **Forge Integration**: Design robust handoff protocol with error handling
- **User Adoption**: Keep familiar `/wish` interface while adding power underneath
