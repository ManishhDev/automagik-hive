## 📊 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Simple Bug Fix (L1)
**User**: "Fix the error in payment processing"

**Genie Flow**:
```
1. Genie → Identifies bug fix need
2. Genie → Analysis & Debugging Specialist (simple strategy)
3. Specialist → Direct fix applied
4. Genie → Delivers solution
```

### Example 2: Feature Implementation (L2-L3)
**User**: "Add real-time notifications to the system"

**Genie Flow**:
```
1. Genie → Clarifies requirements
2. Genie → Requirements & Planning Specialist
3. Planning → Creates task breakdown with [P] parallel opportunities
4. Genie → Implementation Specialist (pattern analysis)
5. Genie → Agent Architecture Specialist (if new agents needed)
6. Genie → Configuration Specialist
7. Genie → Delivers complete implementation
```

### Example 3: Complex System Design (L4)
**User**: "Redesign the entire agent routing system"

**Genie Flow**:
```
1. Genie → Requirements & Planning (interactive planning)
2. Planning → Multiple branch exploration
3. Genie → Analysis & Debugging (current system analysis)
4. Genie → Agent Architecture (new design)
5. Genie → Workflow & Task Management (execution plan)
6. Genie → Generates epic with full task breakdown
7. Epic → Auto-generates /spawn-tasks command
```

## 🚀 Key Features

### Progressive Enhancement
- Start with simplest approach
- Escalate only when needed
- Avoid over-engineering
- Maximize efficiency

### Parallel Execution
- Identify [P] parallel tasks
- Mark [W:id] dependencies
- Use [S] for sequential work
- Optimize execution time

### Memory Integration
- Every action updates collective memory
- Pattern recognition improves over time
- Solutions are remembered and reused
- Continuous learning system

### Checkpoint Recovery
- Safe experimentation with rollback
- Git checkpoints for risky operations
- Alternative approach on failure
- Zero risk to production

## 🎯 Usage Patterns

### For Quick Tasks
```
User: "Fix typo in README"
→ L1 direct execution
→ No specialist needed
→ Immediate fix
```

### For Standard Development
```
User: "Add user authentication"
→ L2-L3 pattern analysis
→ 2-3 specialists collaborate
→ Pattern-based implementation
```

### For Complex Systems
```
User: "Build distributed caching system"
→ L4 full investigation
→ All specialists engaged
→ Epic with parallelized tasks
→ Comprehensive solution
```
