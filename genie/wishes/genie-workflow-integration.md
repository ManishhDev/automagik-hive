### 📋 /planner → Requirements & Planning Genie

**Your workflow features preserved:**
- Interactive, iterative planning
- Branching and revision capabilities
- Step-by-step thinking
- Context persistence

**Enhanced in Genie:**
- Integrated with task decomposition
- Automatic [P]/[W]/[S] notation
- Direct connection to implementation
- Epic generation when needed

## 🎯 Unified Workflow Benefits

### 1. No More Command Confusion
Instead of remembering multiple commands, just express your wish:
- "Fix the payment bug" → Routes to debugging
- "Plan new feature" → Routes to planning
- "Build the API" → Routes to implementation

### 2. Automatic Coordination
Specialists work together seamlessly:
```
Planning → Architecture → Implementation → Configuration
    ↓           ↓              ↓                ↓
  Tasks    Team Design    Code & Tests    Deployment
```

### 3. Progressive Enhancement Everywhere
Every specialist follows the same philosophy:
- L1: Try simple approach first
- L2: Add analysis if needed
- L3: Bring in more specialists
- L4: Go nuclear if necessary

### 4. Unified Memory System
All specialists share and contribute to collective memory:
- Patterns discovered during analysis help implementation
- Bugs fixed are remembered to prevent recurrence
- Successful architectures become templates
- Task parallelization patterns are reused

## 🔧 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Complex Bug Investigation
```
User: "Users report random logouts"

Genie routes to Analysis & Debugging:
- L1: Check obvious issues (session timeout)
- L2: Analyze session management code
- L3: Multi-agent investigation (auth, session, database)
- L4: Nuclear debugging if still not found

Automatic coordination:
- If code changes needed → Implementation Genie
- If architecture issue → Architecture Genie
- If config issue → Configuration Genie
```

### Example 2: New Feature Development
```
User: "Add real-time chat to our app"

Genie routes to Requirements & Planning:
- Interactive planning session
- Branches: WebSocket vs SSE vs Polling
- Task breakdown with parallelization

Automatic handoffs:
- Architecture Genie designs agent structure
- Implementation Genie builds components
- Configuration Genie sets up connections
- Workflow Genie orchestrates deployment
```

### Example 3: System Optimization
```
User: "System is too slow"

Genie coordinates multiple specialists:
- Analysis Genie: Performance analysis mode
- Architecture Genie: Identify bottlenecks
- Implementation Genie: Apply optimizations
- Configuration Genie: Tune settings

Progressive enhancement:
- L1: Quick config tweaks
- L2: Code optimizations
- L3: Architecture changes
- L4: Complete redesign
```

## 🚀 Migration Path

### From Individual Commands to Genie

**Old way:**
```bash
/analyze "Check security"
/fix "Apply security patches"
/build "Add security monitoring"
/test "Verify security"
```

**New way:**
```bash
/wish "Improve system security"
# Genie coordinates all necessary specialists
```

### Command Equivalents

| Old Command | Genie Specialist | Trigger |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| /analyze | Analysis & Debugging | Analysis request |
| /build | Implementation | Build/feature request |
| /fix | Analysis & Debugging | Bug/fix request |
| /nuke | Analysis & Debugging (Nuclear) | When all else fails |
| /planner | Requirements & Planning | Planning request |
| /test | Implementation + Task | Test request |
| /refactor | Architecture + Implementation | Refactor request |

## 📊 Workflow Preservation
