# üõë‚ú® Graceful Shutdown Enhancement - Technical Specification Document

## üìã Project Overview

**Wish ID**: `graceful-shutdown-enhancement`  
**Priority**: High - Infrastructure Quality  
**Complexity**: 8/10 - Multi-component orchestration with progress display  
**Status**: Planning Phase - TSD Created  

**Current Issue**:
Our automagik-hive shutdown shows resource leak warnings:
```
^CINFO:     Shutting down
INFO:     Waiting for application shutdown.
2025-08-28 01:21:44.095 | INFO     | üì± Registered notification provider: log
2025-08-28 01:21:44.095 | INFO     | üì± Registered notification provider: whatsapp
INFO:     Application shutdown complete.
INFO:     Finished server process [2523083]
INFO:     Stopping reloader process [2523075]
/usr/lib/python3.12/multiprocessing/resource_tracker.py:254: UserWarning: resource_tracker: There appear to be 1 leaked semaphore objects to clean up at shutdown
  warnings.warn('resource_tracker: There appear to be %d '

üõë Server stopped by user)
```

**Desired Outcome**:
Clean, professional shutdown like Langflow with:
- Elegant progress display during shutdown phases
- Zero resource leak warnings  
- User-friendly farewell messages
- Proper cleanup of all system resources

## üî¨ Analysis Results - Langflow Shutdown Implementation

### Key Insights from Langflow Analysis

**1. FastAPI Lifespan Context Manager**
- Uses `@asynccontextmanager` with `lifespan` parameter in FastAPI app creation
- Comprehensive finally block handles all cleanup with structured progress display
- Timeout protection (10s) for service teardown to prevent hanging

**2. Progress Display System** (`cli/progress.py`)
- `ProgressIndicator` class with animated step-by-step progress
- Windows-safe Unicode handling with ASCII fallbacks
- Threaded animations with proper cleanup
- Context managers for automatic step completion

**3. Signal Handling** (`__main__.py`)  
- `ProcessManager` class with dedicated signal handlers
- Proper SIGTERM/SIGINT handling with shutdown-in-progress flag
- Process management with 30s timeout + kill fallback
- Clean farewell messages after shutdown completion

**4. Structured Shutdown Phases**
```python
# Langflow's 5-phase shutdown:
# Step 0: Stopping Server - FastAPI lifespan handles this
# Step 1: Cancelling Background Tasks - Cancel async tasks with wait
# Step 2: Cleaning Up Services - Teardown with 10s timeout 
# Step 3: Clearing Temporary Files - Async cleanup of temp directories
# Step 4: Finalizing Shutdown - Completion logging and summary
```

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Design

### Component Analysis

**Current automagik-hive Architecture**:
```
api/serve.py (FastAPI app) ‚Üí orchestrated_startup() ‚Üí services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database connections (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MCP system initialization  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent/Team/Workflow loading
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Background notification tasks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Various async services
```

**Shutdown Integration Points**:
1. **FastAPI Lifespan**: Main orchestration point
2. **Service Registry**: Centralized service cleanup
3. **Background Tasks**: Async task cancellation
4. **Resource Tracking**: Connection and file handle cleanup

### Proposed Shutdown Flow

**Phase 1: Server Stopping**
- FastAPI begins lifespan context exit
- Display "Gracefully stopping server..." with animated progress

**Phase 2: Background Task Cleanup**  
- Cancel notification tasks
- Wait for async task completion with timeout
- Display "Stopping background services..." 

**Phase 3: Service Teardown**
- Database connection cleanup
- MCP system shutdown
- Agent/team resource cleanup  
- Display "Cleaning up services..."

**Phase 4: Resource Finalization**
- File handle cleanup
- Temporary file removal
- Memory cleanup
- Display "Finalizing shutdown..."

**Phase 5: Completion**
- Final status summary
- Professional farewell message
- Exit with clean status

## üîß Simple Implementation Strategy (Following Langflow Pattern)

### KISS Approach - Only 2 Files to Modify

**File 1: `lib/utils/shutdown_progress.py`** (NEW - copy from Langflow)
- Simple progress display class with Windows/Linux compatibility  
- Context manager for step-by-step display
- No complex architecture - just visual feedback

**File 2: `api/serve.py`** (MODIFY - update existing lifespan)
- Add structured finally block like Langflow
- Use shutdown progress display
- Fix resource leaks with proper cleanup

### Langflow's Simple Pattern:
```python
# In lifespan finally block:
shutdown_progress = create_shutdown_progress()
try:
    with shutdown_progress.step(0):  # Server stopping
        await cleanup_background_tasks()
    with shutdown_progress.step(1):  # Services cleanup  
        await cleanup_services()
    with shutdown_progress.step(2):  # Finalization
        logger.info("Shutdown complete")
    shutdown_progress.print_farewell()
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Shutdown error: {e}")
```

### Resource Leak Fix (Simple)
- Find and cancel background async tasks in startup
- Ensure database connections properly closed
- Add proper exception handling in cleanup

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests**:
- `tests/lib/shutdown/test_progress.py` - Progress display functionality
- `tests/lib/shutdown/test_manager.py` - Shutdown manager coordination  
- `tests/lib/shutdown/test_signals.py` - Signal handling behavior

**Integration Tests**:
- `tests/api/test_graceful_shutdown.py` - Full shutdown flow testing
- Resource leak detection via pytest fixtures
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

**Manual Testing**:
- Ctrl+C during various startup phases
- Resource monitoring during shutdown
- Visual verification of progress display
- Platform testing (Windows/Linux/macOS)

## üìö Technical References

### Langflow Implementation Analysis
- **main.py:217-270**: Comprehensive lifespan finally block with 5-phase shutdown
- **cli/progress.py**: Full progress display system with animations
- **__main__.py:47-105**: ProcessManager with signal handling and timeouts

### Key Patterns Identified
1. **Structured Phases**: Clear separation of shutdown responsibilities
2. **Progress Communication**: User feedback during potentially long operations  
3. **Timeout Protection**: Prevent hanging on unresponsive services
4. **Resource Tracking**: Systematic cleanup of all allocated resources
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of cleanup failures

### Simple Implementation Steps
1. Copy `shutdown_progress.py` from Langflow (5 minutes)
2. Add finally block to existing lifespan in `api/serve.py` (10 minutes)  
3. Test Ctrl+C shutdown and fix any resource leaks (15 minutes)

**Total Time**: 30 minutes vs the overengineered approach

**Next Phase**: DDD Creation - Detailed architectural design for implementation
**Implementation Timeline**: Sequential phases with testing at each step
