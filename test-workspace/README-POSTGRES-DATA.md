# POSTGRES DATA DIRECTORY PRESERVATION NOTE\n\nThe /test-workspace/data/postgres/ directory could not be removed due to Docker container ownership permissions.\nThis is a harmless remnant containing PostgreSQL database files from test containers.\n\nTo remove completely (if needed):\n1. Ensure no Docker containers are using this data\n2. Use: sudo rm -rf /test-workspace/data/postgres/\n\nThis does not affect project functionality or organization.
